      "The  Commission  adopted  the  proposal  for  a  Regulation  laying  down  harmonised  rules  on \n",
      "artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act, hereinafter: the AI Act) on 21 April 2021. \n",
      "2. \n",
      "The  Council  unanimously  adopted  its  General  Approach  on  the  proposal  on  6  December \n",
      "2022, while the European Parliament (hereinafter: the EP) confirmed its position in a plenary \n",
      "vote on 14 June 2023. \n",
      "3.  On 14 June 2023, 18 July 2023, 2-3 October 2023 and 24 October 2023 the first four political \n",
      "trilogues  were  held,  during  which  some  of  the  less  controversial  parts  of  the  proposal  were \n",
      "agreed and compromise was also found on the provisions concerning measures in support of \n",
      "innovation,  as  well  as  and  on  the  mechanism  for  classification  of  AI  systems  as  high-risk. \n",
      "Moreover,  during  those  initial  trilogues  the  co-legislators  explored  potential  landing  zones \n",
      "with regard to the remaining issues, in particular the regulation of general purpose AI models \n",
      "and systems, governance, as well the prohibitions and law enforcement package. \n",
      "4.  On 29 November 2023 and 1 December 2023, the Committee of Permanent Representatives \n",
      "granted the Presidency a revised mandate to continue the negotiations on all the outstanding \n",
      "elements  of  the  proposal.  The  fifth  and  final  trilogue  was  held  between  6  and  8  December \n",
      "2023.  During  this  extended  round  of  negotiations  the  Council  and  the  EP  came  to  an \n",
      "agreement  on  all  political  issues  and  successfully  closed  the  interinstitutional  negotiations. \n",
      "Following this political agreement, the co-legislators proceeded to carry out further technical \n",
      "work in January 2024 in order to align the text of the recitals with the text of the articles as \n",
      "agreed during the final trilogue.  \n",
      "5. \n",
      "In the Annex to this document delegations will find the text of the proposal for a Regulation \n",
      "laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (the AI Act), updated according to the \n",
      "provisional political agreement reached at the fifth trilogue between 6 and 8 December 2023. \n",
      "II.  MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE COMPROMISE \n",
      "1.  Subject matter and scope  \n",
      "As  regards  the  subject  matter,  the  compromise  text  of  Article  1(1)  includes  a  high-level \n",
      "statement that one of the purposes of the AI Act  is  to  ensure a high level of protection of \n",
      "health, safety  and fundamental  rights  enshrined in the Charter, which includes democracy, \n",
      "rule of law and environmental protection. However, all subsequent references in the text to \n",
      "the risks  addressed by the Regulation  only include risks to  health, safety and fundamental \n",
      "rights, in line with the Council’s mandate. \n",
      "Concerning the scope, the compromise text makes it clear that national security is excluded. \n",
      "The wording concerning this exclusion in Article 2(3) has been fine tuned to align it more \n",
      "closely  with  the  respective  language  used  in  recently  agreed  legal  acts,  such  as  the  Cyber \n",
      "Resilience  Act  and  the  Data  Act,  while  the  text  of  the  corresponding  Recital  12a  has \n",
      "remained the same as in the Council’s mandate.  \n",
      "2.  Definition of an AI system \n",
      "The definition of an AI  system in  Article 3(1) has been modified to  align it more  closely \n",
      "with  the  work  of  international  organisations  working  on  artificial  intelligence,  notably  the \n",
      "OECD.  Moreover, the corresponding Recital 6 details further the key characteristics of the \n",
      "definition  and  clarifies  that  the  definition  is  not  intended  to  cover  simpler  traditional \n",
      "software systems or programming approaches, which are based on the rules defined solely \n",
      "by  natural  persons  to  automatically  execute  operations.  Additionally,  the  Commission  has \n",
      "been tasked to develop guidelines on the application of the definition of an AI system.  \n",
      "3.  Prohibited AI practices \n",
      "Regarding the list of prohibited AI practices in Article 5, the compromise text includes the \n",
      "changes  as  previously  accepted  by  the  Committee  of  Permanent  Representatives  in  the \n",
      "Council’s  revised  mandate.  This  means  that  the  list  includes  the  prohibition  of  real-time \n",
      "biometric  identification  by  law  enforcement  authorities  in  publicly  accessible  spaces,  but \n",
      "with  some  notable  and  clearly  defined  exceptions,  as  listed  in  Article  5(1)(d),  which  are \n",
      "now  subject  to  a  range  of  safeguards,  including  monitoring  and  oversight  measures  and \n",
      "limited  reporting  obligations  at  EU  level.  Additional  accepted  prohibitions  include \n",
      "untargeted  scraping  of  facial  images  for  the  purpose  of  a  creating  or  expanding  facial \n",
      "recognition  databases,  emotion  recognition  but  only  at  the  workplace  and  in  educational \n",
      "institutions (and with exceptions for safety and medical reasons), a very limited prohibition \n",
      "of biometric categorization based on certain specific beliefs or characteristics, as well as a \n",
      "limited  and  targeted  ban  on  individual  predictive  policing.  The  wording  on  the  predictive \n",
      "policing ban has been slightly modified and it now covers systems which assess or predict \n",
      "the risk of a natural person to commit a criminal offence, based solely on the profiling of a \n",
      "natural  person  or  on  assessing  their  personality  traits  and  characteristics.  However,  this \n",
      "prohibition  will  not  apply  to  AI  systems  used  to  support  the  human  assessment  of  the \n",
      "involvement of a person in a criminal activity.  \n",
      "Finally,  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  as  part  of  the  compromise  other  biometric \n",
      "categorisation  systems  and  emotion  recognition  systems,  as  well  as  post-remote  biometric \n",
      "identification systems, which have not been included in the list of prohibitions in Article 5, \n",
      "have been added to Annex III (List of high-risk AI systems), with some further limitations \n",
      "of their scope. \n",
      "4.  Post-remote biometric identification \n",
      "In  addition  to  being  included  in  the  list  of  high-risk  AI  systems  in  Annex  III,  the  use  of \n",
      "post-remote biometric identification by law enforcement authorities has been made subject \n",
      "to  some  additional  safeguards  in  Article  29.  These  safeguards  include  some  limited \n",
      "transparency  measures  and  the  requirement  for  law  enforcement  authorities  to  request  an \n",
      "authorisation for the use of post-remote biometric identification, which could be given by a \n",
      "judicial authority or an administrative authority whose decision is binding and subject to a \n",
      "judicial  review.  This  can  be  done  prior  or  ex  post,  within  48  hours.  Furthermore,  the \n",
      "compromise  text  clarifies  that  post-remote  biometric  identification  should  not  be  used  for \n",
      "law  enforcement  purposes  in  an  untargeted  way  without  any  link  to  a  criminal  offence,  a \n",
      "criminal proceeding, a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a criminal \n",
      "offence or the search for a specific missing person. \n",
      "5.  Exceptions for law enforcement authorities \n",
      "The compromise agreement preserves all the exceptions for law enforcement authorities that \n",
      "were  added  in  the  Council’s  revised  mandate,  including  derogation  from  conformity \n",
      "assessment  and  the  possibility  to  start  real  world  testing  of  high-risk  AI  systems  without \n",
      "prior  authorisation.  Nevertheless,  in  order  to  secure  these  concessions,  the  Council  had  to \n",
      "agree  that  market  surveillance  authorities  for  high-risk  AI  systems  in  the  field  of  law \n",
      "enforcement  would  be  either  the  data  protection  authorities  or  any  other  authorities \n",
      "designated  pursuant  to  conditions  laid  down  in  Articles  1  to  44  of  the  Law  Enforcement \n",
      "Directive. \n",
      "6.  Fundamental rights impact assessment \n",
      "In line with the Council’s revised mandate, in  Article 29a the compromise text includes a \n",
      "light  version  of  the  obligation  for  some  deployers  to  conduct  a  fundamental  rights  impact \n",
      "assessment. The obligation is relatively easy to comply with, and it concerns only deployers \n",
      "that  are  bodies  governed  by  public  law,  private  actors  providing  public  services,  and \n",
      "deployers that are banking and insurance service providers using AI systems listed as high-\n",
      "risk  in  Annex  III,  point  5,  (b)  and  (ca).  The  fundamental  rights  impact  assessment  will \n",
      "need to be carried out only for aspects not covered by other legal obligations, such as Data \n",
      "Protection  Impact  Assessment  under  the  GDPR  and  will  be  procedurally  aligned  with \n",
      "existing  processes  in  order  to  eliminate  any  overlap  and  additional  burden.  Moreover, \n",
      "compliance with this obligation will be facilitated by the AI Office, which has been tasked \n",
      "with the development of a template for a questionnaire which deployers will be able to use \n",
      "to meet the relevant requirements.  \n",
      "7.  Testing high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes  \n",
      "As part of the compromise, the text of the AI Act includes provisions on testing high-risk AI \n",
      "systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes, in Articles 54a and 54b. \n",
      "The Council’s revised mandate has been preserved in this respect, which means that testing \n",
      "high-risk  AI  systems  in  real  world  conditions  outside  AI  regulatory  sandboxes  will  be \n",
      "possible,  but  it  will  be  subject  to  a  range  of  safeguards,  which  include,  inter  alia,  the \n",
      "requirement  for  approval  from  the  market  surveillance  authority,  the  right  for  affected \n",
      "persons  to  request  to  delete  their  data  after  testing  in  real  world  conditions,  the  right  for \n",
      "market  surveillance  authorities  to  request  information  related  to  testing  in  real  world \n",
      "conditions  from  providers, including the power to conduct  inspections, limited duration of \n",
      "such testing, as well as some additional safeguards designed specifically for testing in real \n",
      "world  conditions  in  the  areas  of  law  enforcement,  migration,  asylum  and  border  control \n",
      "management. \n",
      "8.  General purpose AI models \n",
      "The compromise agreement includes new provisions concerning general purpose AI models \n",
      "(GPAI models) in Articles 52a – 52e. These new rules introduce horizontal obligations for \n",
      "all GPAI models, which will include keeping up-to-date and making available, upon request, \n",
      "technical  documentation  to  the  AI  Office  and  national  competent  authorities.  They  also \n",
      "include  providing  certain  information  and  documentation  to  downstream  providers  for  the \n",
      "purpose of compliance with the AI Act. There are some additional requirements for models \n",
      "with  systemic  risks,  which  would  include  performing  model  evaluation,  making  risk \n",
      "assessments  and \n",
      "taking  risk  mitigation  measures,  ensuring  an  adequate \n",
      "level  of \n",
      "cybersecurity  protection,  and  reporting  serious  incidents  to  the  AI  Office  and  national \n",
      "competent authorities. Compliance with these requirements can be achieved through codes \n",
      "of practice, which will be developed by the industry, with the participation of the Member \n",
      "States (through the AI Board), and facilitated by the AI Office. The drawing up of the codes \n",
      "of  practice  should  be  an  open  process  to  which  all  interested  stakeholders  will  be  invited, \n",
      "both companies as well as civil society and academia. The AI Office will also evaluate these \n",
      "codes of practice and can formally approve them, or, in case they are inadequate to cover the \n",
      "obligations,  provide  common  rules  for  the  implementation  of  the  obligations  through  an \n",
      "implementing  act.  The  compromise  agreement  also  provides  that  standards  will  be  a \n",
      "possibility for compliance in the future. \n",
      "Classification  of  GPAI  models  as  presenting  systemic  risks  will  initially  depend  on  the \n",
      "capability,  either  based  on  a  quantitative  threshold  of  the  cumulative  amount  of  compute \n",
      "used  for  its  training  measured  in  floating  point  operations  (FLOPs),  or  on  an  individual \n",
      "designation decision of the Commission that takes into account criteria listed in Annex IXc \n",
      "(e.g. the number of parameters, quality and size of the dataset,  input and output modalities \n",
      "or the reach measures in business users).The initial FLOPs threshold for this has been set as \n",
      "10^25, so higher than what the EP initially wanted but lower than in the Council’s mandate, \n",
      "which was 10^26. However, in this context it is important to note that the Commission will \n",
      "be obliged to adapt the threshold in the light of evolving technological developments, such \n",
      "as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, in order to keep up with the \n",
      "state of the art, reflecting the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general purpose AI \n",
      "models. \n",
      "Regarding copyright, the compromise agreement states that providers of GPAI models will \n",
      "need  to  put  in  place  a  policy  to  respect  Union  copyright  law,  as  well  as  make  publicly \n",
      "available a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training of the general-\n",
      "purpose AI model, based on a template provided by the AI Office. Recital 60k explains that \n",
      "this summary should not be technically detailed but comprehensive at a general level, while \n",
      "taking  into  due  account  the  need  to  protect  trade  secrets  and  confidential  business \n",
      "information.  \n",
      "Finally,  with  regard  to  GPAI  systems,  the  compromise  agreement  defines  them  as  AI \n",
      "systems  based  on  GPAI  models  that  can  serve  a  variety  of  purposes.  Article  28  includes \n",
      "rules to align them to the risk-based approach of the AI Act. Providers of such systems will \n",
      "be obliged to provide all the information and elements to downstream providers of high-risk \n",
      "AI  systems  so  that  they  can  comply  with  the  respective  requirements,  including  for  the \n",
      "purpose  of  conformity  assessment.  Article  63a  further  clarifies  the  conditions  in  which \n",
      "national market surveillance authorities should collaborate with the AI Office to ensure the \n",
      "compliance of GPAI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose \n",
      "classified as high-risk, when they consider the GPAI systems are not compliant.  \n",
      "9.  Governance and enforcement \n",
      "Linked  to  the  agreements  on  GPAI  models,  as  summarized  in  point  8  above,  the \n",
      "compromise  text  also  includes  the  new  rules  on  governance  in  Title  VI.  While  for  AI \n",
      "systems the market surveillance system on the national level will apply, these new rules for \n",
      "GPAI models provide for a new more centralised system of oversight and enforcement. For \n",
      "this purpose, the AI Office will be established as a new governance structure with a number \n",
      "of  specific  tasks  in  respect  of  GPAI  models,  and  with  a  strong  link  with  the  scientific \n",
      "community to support its work.  \n",
      "The newly proposed governance structure also includes an enhanced role for the AI Board. \n",
      "Its  list  of tasks  has been extended to  give the Member States a stronger  coordination role, \n",
      "including  with  regard  to  AI  regulatory  sandboxes,  consultations  with  stakeholders  and \n",
      "awareness raising activities. The AI Board will also provide opinions to the Commission on \n",
      "the  qualified  alerts  concerning  general  purpose  AI  models.  The  provisions  on  the \n",
      "composition  and  functioning  of  the  AI  Board  have  been  maintained  as  in  the  Council’s \n",
      "General Approach.  \n",
      "The  final  text  also  introduces  two  new  advisory  bodies.  A  scientific  panel  of  independent \n",
      "experts  will  provide  technical  advice  and  input  to  the  AI  Office  and  market  surveillance \n",
      "authorities.  The  scientific  panel  also  has  a  key  role  in  the  enforcement  of  rules  for  GPAI \n",
      "models,  as  it  will  be  able  to  launch  qualified  alerts  of  possible  risks  to  the  AI  Office. \n",
      "Building  on  the  General  Approach,  Member  States  will  have  the  possibility  to  call  upon \n",
      "experts of the scientific  panels  to  support their  market  surveillance activities. An advisory \n",
      "forum will provide stakeholder input to the Commission (including the AI Office) and to the \n",
      "AI  Board.  It  will  comprise  a  balanced  selection  of  stakeholders,  including  industry,  start-\n",
      "ups, SMEs, civil society and academia. \n",
      "Finally,  on  the  issue  of  appointing  more  than  one  competent  authority  covered  by  Article \n",
      "59(2), the compromise text maintains the Council’s position, which gives the Member States \n",
      "the flexibility to appoint at least one notifying authority and at least one market surveillance \n",
      "authority as national competent authorities. In addition, Member States shall designate one \n",
      "market surveillance authority to act as a single point of contact.  \n",
      "10. Derogation from conformity assessment \n",
      "In  line  with  the  Council’s  mandate,  the  compromise  text  preserves  the  derogation  from \n",
      "conformity assessment in Article 47(1), and also the related exemption (urgency procedure) \n",
      "for  law  enforcement  authorities  in  Article  47(1a),  without  the  need  for  judicial \n",
      "authorisation.  However,  to  secure this  concession, it has been necessary  to re-introduce in \n",
      "the text the wording regarding the control of the authorisation process by the Commission, \n",
      "as  provided  in  points  3,  4  and  5  of  Article  47,  which  were  previously  deleted  in  the \n",
      "Council’s General Approach. \n",
      "11. AI systems already placed on the market or put into service \n",
      "Concerning  AI  systems  already  placed  on  the  market  or  put  into  service,  in  the  case  of \n",
      "public authorities which are providers or deployers of high-risk AI systems the compromise \n",
      "agreement in Article 83(2) is to offer them 4 years from the entry into application to make \n",
      "their  systems  compliant.  This  change  does  not  depart  significantly  from  the  Council’s \n",
      "position,  as  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  within  this  4-year  period  such  systems  would  not  go \n",
      "through  a  substantial  modification,  which  was  supposed  to  trigger  the  requirement  to \n",
      "comply in the Council’s General Approach. Moreover, in  Article 83(3) it has been agreed \n",
      "that every GPAI model that is placed on the market before the entry into application of the \n",
      "provisions related to GPAI models (12 months after entry into force) will have 2 years after \n",
      "the  date  if  entry  into  application  of  these  provisions  (3  years  in  total)  to  be  brought  in \n",
      "compliance (irrespective of whether there is a substantial modification or not). \n",
      "12. Implementing acts and delegated acts \n",
      "With regard to delegated and implementing acts, the compromise text preserves the choices \n",
      "as in the Council’s revised mandate, with the exception of two cases of implementing acts \n",
      "where  it  was  clarified  that  legally  only  delegated  acts  are  possible,  namely  to  update  the \n",
      "thresholds of FLOPs in Article 52a and to update the methodology for the classification of \n",
      "high-impact models in Article 52b. \n",
      "13. Penalties \n",
      "The  amounts  of  penalties  for  the  infringements  of  the  various  aspects  of  the  AI  Act  have \n",
      "been fine tuned in Article 71. Notably, for non-compliance with the provisions concerning \n",
      "prohibited AI practices outlined in Article 5, the penalty has been set at 35 million EUR or \n",
      "7% of annual turnover, slightly above the limit set in the Council’s revised mandate, which \n",
      "was  35  million  EUR  or  6.5%  of  annual  turnover.  On  the  other  hand,  the  amounts  of \n",
      "penalties agreed for the remaining cases are slightly lower than in the Council’s position. \n",
      "Finally, Article 72a sets out the fines for providers of general purpose AI models, in case of \n",
      "infringements  of  the  obligations  or  non-compliance  with  the  enforcement  measures,  e.g. \n",
      "requests  for  information.  The  maximum  amount  of  fines  has  been  aligned  to  those  for \n",
      "providers of high-risk AI systems. It is important to highlight that there will be an additional \n",
      "grace period for providers of general purpose AI models, because no fines can be imposed \n",
      "during the first year after entry into application of the rules. \n",
      "14. Entry into application \n",
      "On the entry of application as specified in Article 85, the compromise agreement provides \n",
      "for 24 months with regard to most parts of the Regulation, with slightly shorter deadlines for \n",
      "some elements, namely 6 months for prohibitions and 12 months for provisions concerning \n",
      "notifying  authorities  and  notified  bodies,  governance,  general  purpose  AI  models, \n",
      "confidentiality  and  penalties,  and  a  slightly  longer  deadline  of  36  months  for  high-risk  AI \n",
      "systems covered by Annex II. \n",
      "III.  CONCLUSION \n",
      "1.  The Presidency invites the Committee of the Permanent Representatives to:  \n",
