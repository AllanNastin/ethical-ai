       "'I. \\n1. \\nINTRODUCTION \\nThe  Commission  adopted  the  proposal  for  a  Regulation  laying  down  harmonised  rules  on \\nartificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act, hereinafter: the AI Act) on 21 April 2021. \\n2. \\nThe  Council  unanimously  adopted  its  General  Approach  on  the  proposal  on  6  December \\n2022, while the European Parliament (hereinafter: the EP) confirmed its position in a plenary \\nvote on 14 June 2023. \\n3.  On 14 June 2023, 18 July 2023, 2-3 October 2023 and 24 October 2023 the first four political \\ntrilogues  were  held,  during  which  some  of  the  less  controversial  parts  of  the  proposal  were \\nagreed and compromise was also found on the provisions concerning measures in support of \\ninnovation,  as  well  as  and  on  the  mechanism  for  classification  of  AI  systems  as  high-risk. \\nMoreover,  during  those  initial  trilogues  the  co-legislators  explored  potential  landing  zones \\nwith regard to the remaining issues, in particular the regulation of general purpose AI models \\nand systems, governance, as well the prohibitions and law enforcement package. \\n4.  On 29 November 2023 and 1 December 2023, the Committee of Permanent Representatives \\ngranted the Presidency a revised mandate to continue the negotiations on all the outstanding \\nelements  of  the  proposal.  The  fifth  and  final  trilogue  was  held  between  6  and  8  December \\n2023.  During  this  extended  round  of  negotiations  the  Council  and  the  EP  came  to  an \\nagreement  on  all  political  issues  and  successfully  closed  the  interinstitutional  negotiations. \\nFollowing this political agreement, the co-legislators proceeded to carry out further technical \\nwork in January 2024 in order to align the text of the recitals with the text of the articles as \\nagreed during the final trilogue.  \\n5. \\nIn the Annex to this document delegations will find the text of the proposal for a Regulation \\nlaying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (the AI Act), updated according to the \\nprovisional political agreement reached at the fifth trilogue between 6 and 8 December 2023. \\nII.  MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE COMPROMISE \\n1.  Subject matter and scope  \\nAs  regards  the  subject  matter,  the  compromise  text  of  Article  1(1)  includes  a  high-level \\nstatement that one of the purposes of the AI Act  is  to  ensure a high level of protection of \\nhealth, safety  and fundamental  rights  enshrined in the Charter, which includes democracy, \\nrule of law and environmental protection. However, all subsequent references in the text to \\nthe risks  addressed by the Regulation  only include risks to  health, safety and fundamental \\nrights, in line with the Council’s mandate. \\nConcerning the scope, the compromise text makes it clear that national security is excluded. \\nThe wording concerning this exclusion in Article 2(3) has been fine tuned to align it more \\nclosely  with  the  respective  language  used  in  recently  agreed  legal  acts,  such  as  the  Cyber \\nResilience  Act  and  the  Data  Act,  while  the  text  of  the  corresponding  Recital  12a  has \\nremained the same as in the Council’s mandate.  \\n2.  Definition of an AI system \\nThe definition of an AI  system in  Article 3(1) has been modified to  align it more  closely \\nwith  the  work  of  international  organisations  working  on  artificial  intelligence,  notably  the \\nOECD.  Moreover, the corresponding Recital 6 details further the key characteristics of the \\ndefinition  and  clarifies  that  the  definition  is  not  intended  to  cover  simpler  traditional \\nsoftware systems or programming approaches, which are based on the rules defined solely \\nby  natural  persons  to  automatically  execute  operations.  Additionally,  the  Commission  has \\nbeen tasked to develop guidelines on the application of the definition of an AI system.  \\n3.  Prohibited AI practices \\nRegarding the list of prohibited AI practices in Article 5, the compromise text includes the \\nchanges  as  previously  accepted  by  the  Committee  of  Permanent  Representatives  in  the \\nCouncil’s  revised  mandate.  This  means  that  the  list  includes  the  prohibition  of  real-time \\nbiometric  identification  by  law  enforcement  authorities  in  publicly  accessible  spaces,  but \\nwith  some  notable  and  clearly  defined  exceptions,  as  listed  in  Article  5(1)(d),  which  are \\nnow  subject  to  a  range  of  safeguards,  including  monitoring  and  oversight  measures  and \\nlimited  reporting  obligations  at  EU  level.  Additional  accepted  prohibitions  include \\nuntargeted  scraping  of  facial  images  for  the  purpose  of  a  creating  or  expanding  facial \\nrecognition  databases,  emotion  recognition  but  only  at  the  workplace  and  in  educational \\ninstitutions (and with exceptions for safety and medical reasons), a very limited prohibition \\nof biometric categorization based on certain specific beliefs or characteristics, as well as a \\nlimited  and  targeted  ban  on  individual  predictive  policing.  The  wording  on  the  predictive \\npolicing ban has been slightly modified and it now covers systems which assess or predict \\nthe risk of a natural person to commit a criminal offence, based solely on the profiling of a \\nnatural  person  or  on  assessing  their  personality  traits  and  characteristics.  However,  this \\nprohibition  will  not  apply  to  AI  systems  used  to  support  the  human  assessment  of  the \\ninvolvement of a person in a criminal activity.  \\nFinally,  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  as  part  of  the  compromise  other  biometric \\ncategorisation  systems  and  emotion  recognition  systems,  as  well  as  post-remote  biometric \\nidentification systems, which have not been included in the list of prohibitions in Article 5, \\nhave been added to Annex III (List of high-risk AI systems), with some further limitations \\nof their scope. \\n4.  Post-remote biometric identification \\nIn  addition  to  being  included  in  the  list  of  high-risk  AI  systems  in  Annex  III,  the  use  of \\npost-remote biometric identification by law enforcement authorities has been made subject \\nto  some  additional  safeguards  in  Article  29.  These  safeguards  include  some  limited \\ntransparency  measures  and  the  requirement  for  law  enforcement  authorities  to  request  an \\nauthorisation for the use of post-remote biometric identification, which could be given by a \\njudicial authority or an administrative authority whose decision is binding and subject to a \\njudicial  review.  This  can  be  done  prior  or  ex  post,  within  48  hours.  Furthermore,  the \\ncompromise  text  clarifies  that  post-remote  biometric  identification  should  not  be  used  for \\nlaw  enforcement  purposes  in  an  untargeted  way  without  any  link  to  a  criminal  offence,  a \\ncriminal proceeding, a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a criminal \\noffence or the search for a specific missing person. \\n5.  Exceptions for law enforcement authorities \\nThe compromise agreement preserves all the exceptions for law enforcement authorities that \\nwere  added  in  the  Council’s  revised  mandate,  including  derogation  from  conformity \\nassessment  and  the  possibility  to  start  real  world  testing  of  high-risk  AI  systems  without \\nprior  authorisation.  Nevertheless,  in  order  to  secure  these  concessions,  the  Council  had  to \\nagree  that  market  surveillance  authorities  for  high-risk  AI  systems  in  the  field  of  law \\nenforcement  would  be  either  the  data  protection  authorities  or  any  other  authorities \\ndesignated  pursuant  to  conditions  laid  down  in  Articles  1  to  44  of  the  Law  Enforcement \\nDirective. \\n6.  Fundamental rights impact assessment \\nIn line with the Council’s revised mandate, in  Article 29a the compromise text includes a \\nlight  version  of  the  obligation  for  some  deployers  to  conduct  a  fundamental  rights  impact \\nassessment. The obligation is relatively easy to comply with, and it concerns only deployers \\nthat  are  bodies  governed  by  public  law,  private  actors  providing  public  services,  and \\ndeployers that are banking and insurance service providers using AI systems listed as high-\\nrisk  in  Annex  III,  point  5,  (b)  and  (ca).  The  fundamental  rights  impact  assessment  will \\nneed to be carried out only for aspects not covered by other legal obligations, such as Data \\nProtection  Impact  Assessment  under  the  GDPR  and  will  be  procedurally  aligned  with \\nexisting  processes  in  order  to  eliminate  any  overlap  and  additional  burden.  Moreover, \\ncompliance with this obligation will be facilitated by the AI Office, which has been tasked \\nwith the development of a template for a questionnaire which deployers will be able to use \\nto meet the relevant requirements.  \\n7.  Testing high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes  \\nAs part of the compromise, the text of the AI Act includes provisions on testing high-risk AI \\nsystems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes, in Articles 54a and 54b. \\nThe Council’s revised mandate has been preserved in this respect, which means that testing \\nhigh-risk  AI  systems  in  real  world  conditions  outside  AI  regulatory  sandboxes  will  be \\npossible,  but  it  will  be  subject  to  a  range  of  safeguards,  which  include,  inter  alia,  the \\nrequirement  for  approval  from  the  market  surveillance  authority,  the  right  for  affected \\npersons  to  request  to  delete  their  data  after  testing  in  real  world  conditions,  the  right  for \\nmarket  surveillance  authorities  to  request  information  related  to  testing  in  real  world \\nconditions  from  providers, including the power to conduct  inspections, limited duration of \\nsuch testing, as well as some additional safeguards designed specifically for testing in real \\nworld  conditions  in  the  areas  of  law  enforcement,  migration,  asylum  and  border  control \\nmanagement. \\n8.  General purpose AI models \\nThe compromise agreement includes new provisions concerning general purpose AI models \\n(GPAI models) in Articles 52a – 52e. These new rules introduce horizontal obligations for \\nall GPAI models, which will include keeping up-to-date and making available, upon request, \\ntechnical  documentation  to  the  AI  Office  and  national  competent  authorities.  They  also \\ninclude  providing  certain  information  and  documentation  to  downstream  providers  for  the \\npurpose of compliance with the AI Act. There are some additional requirements for models \\nwith  systemic  risks,  which  would  include  performing  model  evaluation,  making  risk \\nassessments  and \\ntaking  risk  mitigation  measures,  ensuring  an  adequate \\nlevel  of \\ncybersecurity  protection,  and  reporting  serious  incidents  to  the  AI  Office  and  national \\ncompetent authorities. Compliance with these requirements can be achieved through codes \\nof practice, which will be developed by the industry, with the participation of the Member \\nStates (through the AI Board), and facilitated by the AI Office. The drawing up of the codes \\nof  practice  should  be  an  open  process  to  which  all  interested  stakeholders  will  be  invited, \\nboth companies as well as civil society and academia. The AI Office will also evaluate these \\ncodes of practice and can formally approve them, or, in case they are inadequate to cover the \\nobligations,  provide  common  rules  for  the  implementation  of  the  obligations  through  an \\nimplementing  act.  The  compromise  agreement  also  provides  that  standards  will  be  a \\npossibility for compliance in the future. \\nClassification  of  GPAI  models  as  presenting  systemic  risks  will  initially  depend  on  the \\ncapability,  either  based  on  a  quantitative  threshold  of  the  cumulative  amount  of  compute \\nused  for  its  training  measured  in  floating  point  operations  (FLOPs),  or  on  an  individual \\ndesignation decision of the Commission that takes into account criteria listed in Annex IXc \\n(e.g. the number of parameters, quality and size of the dataset,  input and output modalities \\nor the reach measures in business users).The initial FLOPs threshold for this has been set as \\n10^25, so higher than what the EP initially wanted but lower than in the Council’s mandate, \\nwhich was 10^26. However, in this context it is important to note that the Commission will \\nbe obliged to adapt the threshold in the light of evolving technological developments, such \\nas algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, in order to keep up with the \\nstate of the art, reflecting the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general purpose AI \\nmodels. \\nRegarding copyright, the compromise agreement states that providers of GPAI models will \\nneed  to  put  in  place  a  policy  to  respect  Union  copyright  law,  as  well  as  make  publicly \\navailable a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training of the general-\\npurpose AI model, based on a template provided by the AI Office. Recital 60k explains that \\nthis summary should not be technically detailed but comprehensive at a general level, while \\ntaking  into  due  account  the  need  to  protect  trade  secrets  and  confidential  business \\ninformation.  \\nFinally,  with  regard  to  GPAI  systems,  the  compromise  agreement  defines  them  as  AI \\nsystems  based  on  GPAI  models  that  can  serve  a  variety  of  purposes.  Article  28  includes \\nrules to align them to the risk-based approach of the AI Act. Providers of such systems will \\nbe obliged to provide all the information and elements to downstream providers of high-risk \\nAI  systems  so  that  they  can  comply  with  the  respective  requirements,  including  for  the \\npurpose  of  conformity  assessment.  Article  63a  further  clarifies  the  conditions  in  which \\nnational market surveillance authorities should collaborate with the AI Office to ensure the \\ncompliance of GPAI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose \\nclassified as high-risk, when they consider the GPAI systems are not compliant.  \\n9.  Governance and enforcement \\nLinked  to  the  agreements  on  GPAI  models,  as  summarized  in  point  8  above,  the \\ncompromise  text  also  includes  the  new  rules  on  governance  in  Title  VI.  While  for  AI \\nsystems the market surveillance system on the national level will apply, these new rules for \\nGPAI models provide for a new more centralised system of oversight and enforcement. For \\nthis purpose, the AI Office will be established as a new governance structure with a number \\nof  specific  tasks  in  respect  of  GPAI  models,  and  with  a  strong  link  with  the  scientific \\ncommunity to support its work.  \\nThe newly proposed governance structure also includes an enhanced role for the AI Board. \\nIts  list  of tasks  has been extended to  give the Member States a stronger  coordination role, \\nincluding  with  regard  to  AI  regulatory  sandboxes,  consultations  with  stakeholders  and \\nawareness raising activities. The AI Board will also provide opinions to the Commission on \\nthe  qualified  alerts  concerning  general  purpose  AI  models.  The  provisions  on  the \\ncomposition  and  functioning  of  the  AI  Board  have  been  maintained  as  in  the  Council’s \\nGeneral Approach.  \\nThe  final  text  also  introduces  two  new  advisory  bodies.  A  scientific  panel  of  independent \\nexperts  will  provide  technical  advice  and  input  to  the  AI  Office  and  market  surveillance \\nauthorities.  The  scientific  panel  also  has  a  key  role  in  the  enforcement  of  rules  for  GPAI \\nmodels,  as  it  will  be  able  to  launch  qualified  alerts  of  possible  risks  to  the  AI  Office. \\nBuilding  on  the  General  Approach,  Member  States  will  have  the  possibility  to  call  upon \\nexperts of the scientific  panels  to  support their  market  surveillance activities. An advisory \\nforum will provide stakeholder input to the Commission (including the AI Office) and to the \\nAI  Board.  It  will  comprise  a  balanced  selection  of  stakeholders,  including  industry,  start-\\nups, SMEs, civil society and academia. \\nFinally,  on  the  issue  of  appointing  more  than  one  competent  authority  covered  by  Article \\n59(2), the compromise text maintains the Council’s position, which gives the Member States \\nthe flexibility to appoint at least one notifying authority and at least one market surveillance \\nauthority as national competent authorities. In addition, Member States shall designate one \\nmarket surveillance authority to act as a single point of contact.  \\n10. Derogation from conformity assessment \\nIn  line  with  the  Council’s  mandate,  the  compromise  text  preserves  the  derogation  from \\nconformity assessment in Article 47(1), and also the related exemption (urgency procedure) \\nfor  law  enforcement  authorities  in  Article  47(1a),  without  the  need  for  judicial \\nauthorisation.  However,  to  secure this  concession, it has been necessary  to re-introduce in \\nthe text the wording regarding the control of the authorisation process by the Commission, \\nas  provided  in  points  3,  4  and  5  of  Article  47,  which  were  previously  deleted  in  the \\nCouncil’s General Approach. \\n11. AI systems already placed on the market or put into service \\nConcerning  AI  systems  already  placed  on  the  market  or  put  into  service,  in  the  case  of \\npublic authorities which are providers or deployers of high-risk AI systems the compromise \\nagreement in Article 83(2) is to offer them 4 years from the entry into application to make \\ntheir  systems  compliant.  This  change  does  not  depart  significantly  from  the  Council’s \\nposition,  as  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  within  this  4-year  period  such  systems  would  not  go \\nthrough  a  substantial  modification,  which  was  supposed  to  trigger  the  requirement  to \\ncomply in the Council’s General Approach. Moreover, in  Article 83(3) it has been agreed \\nthat every GPAI model that is placed on the market before the entry into application of the \\nprovisions related to GPAI models (12 months after entry into force) will have 2 years after \\nthe  date  if  entry  into  application  of  these  provisions  (3  years  in  total)  to  be  brought  in \\ncompliance (irrespective of whether there is a substantial modification or not). \\n12. Implementing acts and delegated acts \\nWith regard to delegated and implementing acts, the compromise text preserves the choices \\nas in the Council’s revised mandate, with the exception of two cases of implementing acts \\nwhere  it  was  clarified  that  legally  only  delegated  acts  are  possible,  namely  to  update  the \\nthresholds of FLOPs in Article 52a and to update the methodology for the classification of \\nhigh-impact models in Article 52b. \\n13. Penalties \\nThe  amounts  of  penalties  for  the  infringements  of  the  various  aspects  of  the  AI  Act  have \\nbeen fine tuned in Article 71. Notably, for non-compliance with the provisions concerning \\nprohibited AI practices outlined in Article 5, the penalty has been set at 35 million EUR or \\n7% of annual turnover, slightly above the limit set in the Council’s revised mandate, which \\nwas  35  million  EUR  or  6.5%  of  annual  turnover.  On  the  other  hand,  the  amounts  of \\npenalties agreed for the remaining cases are slightly lower than in the Council’s position. \\nFinally, Article 72a sets out the fines for providers of general purpose AI models, in case of \\ninfringements  of  the  obligations  or  non-compliance  with  the  enforcement  measures,  e.g. \\nrequests  for  information.  The  maximum  amount  of  fines  has  been  aligned  to  those  for \\nproviders of high-risk AI systems. It is important to highlight that there will be an additional \\ngrace period for providers of general purpose AI models, because no fines can be imposed \\nduring the first year after entry into application of the rules. \\n14. Entry into application \\nOn the entry of application as specified in Article 85, the compromise agreement provides \\nfor 24 months with regard to most parts of the Regulation, with slightly shorter deadlines for \\nsome elements, namely 6 months for prohibitions and 12 months for provisions concerning \\nnotifying  authorities  and  notified  bodies,  governance,  general  purpose  AI  models, \\nconfidentiality  and  penalties,  and  a  slightly  longer  deadline  of  36  months  for  high-risk  AI \\nsystems covered by Annex II. \\nIII.  CONCLUSION \\n1.  The Presidency invites the Committee of the Permanent Representatives to:  \\na.  endorse the annexed compromise text as agreed with the European Parliament during \\nthe final trilogue, and \\nb.  mandate the Presidency to inform the European Parliament that, should the European \\nParliament  adopt  its  position  at  first  reading,  in  accordance  with  Article  294 \\nparagraph 3 of the Treaty, in the form set out in the compromise package contained \\nin  the  Annex  to  this  document  (subject  to  revision  by  the  lawyer  linguists  of  both \\ninstitutions), the Council would, in accordance with Article 294, paragraph 4 of the \\nTreaty, approve the European Parliament’s position and the act  shall be adopted in \\nthe wording which corresponds to the European Parliament’s position. \\n_______________________ \\nANNEX \\n2021/0106 (COD) \\nProposal for a \\nREGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL \\nLAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE \\n(ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION \\nLEGISLATIVE ACTS \\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, \\nHaving regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 16 \\nand 114 thereof, \\nHaving regard to the proposal from the European Commission, \\nAfter transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, \\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee1, \\nHaving regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank2, \\nHaving regard to the joint opinion of the European Data Protection Board and the European Data \\nProtection Supervisor, \\nHaving regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions3, \\nActing in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, \\nWhereas: \\n(1) \\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by \\nlaying down a uniform legal framework in particular for the development, placing on the \\n                                                 \\nmarket, putting into service and the use of artificial intelligence systems in the Union in \\nconformity with Union values,  to promote the uptake of human centric and  trustworthy \\nartificial intelligence while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, \\nfundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy  and rule of law and \\nenvironmental protection, against harmful effects of artificial intelligence  systems in the \\nUnion and to support innovation. This regulation ensures the free movement of AI-based \\ngoods and services cross-border, thus preventing Member States from imposing \\nrestrictions on the development, marketing and use of Artificial Intelligence systems (AI \\nsystems), unless explicitly authorised by this Regulation.  \\n(1a) \\nThis Regulation should be applied in conformity with the values of the Union enshrined in \\nthe Charter facilitating the protection of individuals, companies, democracy and rule of law \\nand the environment while boosting innovation and employment and making the Union a \\nleader in the uptake of trustworthy AI. \\n(2) \\nAI systems can be easily deployed in multiple sectors of the economy and society, \\nincluding cross border, and circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have \\nalready explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is \\ntrustworthy and safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights \\nobligations. Differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and \\ndecrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or use AI systems. A consistent \\nand high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured in order to \\nachieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the free circulation, innovation, \\ndeployment and uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal \\nmarket should be prevented, by laying down uniform obligations for operators and \\nguaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of \\npersons throughout the internal market based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the \\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the extent that this Regulation contains \\nspecific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data \\nconcerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for  remote biometric identification for the \\npurpose of law enforcement, for the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural \\npersons for the purpose of law enforcement and for the use of AI systems of biometric \\ncategorization for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation, \\nin as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. In light of those \\nspecific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the \\nEuropean Data Protection Board. \\n(3) \\nArtificial intelligence is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide \\narray of economic, environmental and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of \\nindustries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and \\nresource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and \\norganisations, the use of artificial intelligence can provide key competitive advantages to \\ncompanies and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in \\nhealthcare, farming, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, \\ninfrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, \\njustice, resource and energy efficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and \\nrestoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation. \\n(4) \\nAt the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use, \\nand level of technological development, artificial intelligence may generate risks and cause \\nharm to public interests and fundamental rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm \\nmight be material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic \\nharm. \\n(4a) \\nGiven the major impact that artificial intelligence can have on society and the need to build \\ntrust, it is vital for artificial intelligence and its regulatory framework to be developed \\naccording to Union values enshrined in Article 2 TEU, the fundamental rights and \\nfreedoms enshrined in the Treaties, the Charter. As a pre-requisite, artificial intelligence \\nshould be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the \\nultimate aim of increasing human well-being. \\n(4aa)  \\nIn order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards \\nhealth, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for all high-risk AI systems should be \\nestablished. Those rules should be consistent with the Charter of fundamental rights of the \\nEuropean Union (the Charter) and should be non-discriminatory and in line with the \\nUnion’s international trade commitments. They should also take into account the European \\nDeclaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade (2023/C 23/01) and the \\nEthics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the High-Level Expert \\nGroup on Artificial Intelligence.  \\n(5) \\nA Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence is \\ntherefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of artificial intelligence in the \\ninternal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, \\nsuch as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, \\nrule of law and environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To \\nachieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market, putting into service and \\nuse of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the \\ninternal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement \\nof goods and services. These rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental \\nrights, supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling to a European ecosystem of public \\nand private actors creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the \\npotential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down \\nthose rules as well as measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on SMEs \\nincluding startups, this Regulation supports the objective of promoting the European \\nhuman-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the development of secure, \\ntrustworthy and ethical artificial intelligence as stated by the European Council4, and it \\nensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the the European \\nParliament5. \\n(5a) \\nThe harmonised rules on the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI \\nsystems laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with its New \\nLegislative Framework approach, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, \\nnotably on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, and \\nprotection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary. As a \\nconsequence all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and \\nother persons who may be negatively impacted by AI systems, including as regards the \\ncompensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July \\n1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the \\nMember States concerning liability for defective products, remain unaffected and fully \\napplicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and protection of workers, this \\nRegulation should therefore not affect Union law on social policy and national labour law, \\nin compliance with Union law, concerning employment and working conditions, including \\n                                                 \\nhealth and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers. This \\nRegulation should also not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the \\nMember States and at Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other \\naction covered by the specific industrial relations systems in Member States as well as, the \\nright to negotiate, to conclude and enforce collective agreements or to take collective \\naction in accordance with national law. [This Regulation should not affect the provisions \\naiming to improve working conditions in platform work set out in Directive ... [COD \\n2021/414/EC]] On top of that, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such \\nexisting rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, \\nincluding in respect of transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI \\nsystems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI value \\nchain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national laws, in compliance \\nwith Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such \\nlaws fall outside the scope of this Regulation or pursue other legitimate public interest \\nobjectives than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national labour law and the \\nlaws on the protection of minors (i.e. persons below the age of 18) taking into account the \\nUnited Nations General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights, insofar as they are \\nnot specific to AI systems and pursue other legitimate public interest objectives, should not \\nbe affected by this Regulation. \\n(5aa)   The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by \\nRegulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive 2016/680. Directive \\n2002/58/EC additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, \\nincluding by way of providing conditions for any personal and non-personal data storing in \\nand access from terminal equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for \\nsustainable and responsible data processing, including where datasets include a mix of \\npersonal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application of \\nexisting Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and \\npowers of the independent supervisory authorities competent to monitor compliance with \\nthose instruments. It also does not affect the obligations of providers and deployers of AI \\nsystems in their role as data controllers or processors stemming from national or Union law \\non the protection of personal data in so far as the design, the development or the use of AI \\nsystems involves the processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that data \\nsubjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such Union \\nlaw, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, including \\nprofiling. Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service and the \\nuse of AI systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the effective \\nimplementation and enable the exercise of the data subjects’ rights and other remedies \\nguaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other fundamental \\nrights. \\n(5ab)   This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of \\nintermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament \\nand of the Council [as amended by the Digital Services Act]. \\n(6) \\nThe notion of AI system in this Regulation should be clearly defined and closely aligned \\nwith the work of international organisations working on artificial intelligence to ensure \\nlegal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing \\nthe flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field.  \\nMoreover, it should be based on key characteristics of artificial intelligence systems, that \\ndistinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and \\nshould not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to \\nautomatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to \\ninfer. This inference refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, \\ncontent, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual \\nenvironments and to a capability of AI systems to derive models and/or algorithms from \\ninputs/data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include \\nmachine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives; and \\nlogic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic \\nrepresentation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer goes beyond \\nbasic data processing, enable learning, reasoning or modelling. The term “machine-based” \\nrefers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference to explicit or implicit \\nobjectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives \\nor to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the \\nintended purpose of the AI system in a specific context. For the purposes of this \\nRegulation, environments should be understood as the contexts in which the AI systems \\noperate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system, reflect different functions performed \\nby AI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions.  AI \\nsystems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have \\nsome degree of independence of actions from human involvement and of capabilities to \\noperate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could exhibit after \\ndeployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. \\nAI systems can be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective \\nof whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the \\nfunctionality of the product without being integrated therein (non-embedded). \\n(6a) \\nThe notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any natural \\nor legal person, including a public authority, agency or other body, using an AI system \\nunder its authority, except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non-\\nprofessional activity. Depending on the type of AI system, the use of the system may affect \\npersons other than the deployer.  \\n(7) \\nThe notion of biometric data used in this Regulation should be interpreted in light of the \\nnotion of biometric data as defined in Article 4(14) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the \\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council 6, Article 3(18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of \\nthe European Parliament and of the Council 7  and Article 3(13) of Directive (EU) \\n2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8.Biometric data can allow for the \\nauthentication, identification or categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of \\nemotions of natural persons. \\n(7a) \\nThe notion of biometric identification as used in this Regulation should be defined as the \\nautomated recognition of physical, physiological and behavioural human features such as \\nthe face, eye movement, body shape, voice, prosody, gait, posture, heart rate, blood \\npressure, odour, keystrokes characteristics, for the purpose of establishing an individual’s \\nidentity by comparing biometric data of that individual to stored biometric data of \\nindividuals in a reference database, irrespective of whether the individual has given its \\nconsent or not.  This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, \\nwhich includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural \\n                                                 \\nperson is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person \\nfor the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security \\naccess to premises. \\n(7b) \\nThe notion of biometric categorisation as used in this Regulation should be defined as \\nassigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data. Such \\nspecific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, \\nbehavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national minority, \\nsexual or political orientation. This does not include biometric categorization systems that \\nare a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial service meaning \\nthat the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without the principal \\nservice and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the \\napplicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters categorizing facial or body \\nfeatures used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can \\nonly be used in relation to the principal service which consists in selling a product by \\nallowing the consumer to preview the display of the product on him or herself and help the \\nconsumer to make a purchase decision. Filters used on online social network services \\nwhich categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos \\ncould also be considered as ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the \\nprincipal service of the social network services consisting in the sharing of content online. \\n(8) \\nThe notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this Regulation should be \\ndefined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons \\nwithout their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a \\nperson’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, \\nirrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Such \\nremote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple persons or \\ntheir behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the identification of \\nnatural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI systems intended to be \\nused for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to \\nconfirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm \\nthe identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking \\na device or having security access to premises. This exclusion is justified by the fact that \\nsuch systems are likely to have a minor impact on fundamental rights of natural persons \\ncompared to the remote biometric identification systems which may be used for the \\nprocessing of the biometric data of a large number of persons without their active \\ninvolvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the \\ncomparison and the identification occur all instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any \\nevent without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no scope for \\ncircumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems in \\nquestion by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or \\n‘near-‘live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a camera or other device with \\nsimilar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data have \\nalready been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant \\ndelay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit \\ntelevision cameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the \\nsystem in respect of the natural persons concerned. \\n(8a) \\nThe notion of emotion recognition system for the purpose of this regulation should be \\ndefined as an AI system for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions \\nof natural persons on the basis of their biometric data. This refers to emotions or intentions \\nsuch as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, embarrassment, excitement, shame, \\ncontempt, satisfaction and amusement. It does not include physical states, such as pain or \\nfatigue. It does not refer for example to systems used in detecting the state of fatigue of \\nprofessional pilots or drivers for the purpose of preventing accidents. It does also not \\ninclude the mere detection of readily apparent expressions, gestures or movements, unless \\nthey are used for identifying or inferring emotions. These expressions can be basic facial \\nexpressions such as a frown or a smile, or gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or \\nhead, or characteristics of a person’s voice, for example a raised voice or whispering.  \\n(9) \\nFor the purposes of this Regulation the notion of publicly accessible space should be \\nunderstood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to an undetermined number \\nof natural persons, and irrespective of whether the place in question is privately or publicly \\nowned and irrespective of the activity for which the place may be used, such as commerce \\n(for instance, shops, restaurants, cafés), services (for instance, banks, professional \\nactivities, hospitality), sport (for instance, swimming pools, gyms, stadiums), transport (for \\ninstance, bus, metro and railway stations, airports, means of transport ), entertainment (for \\ninstance, cinemas, theatres, museums, concert and conference halls) leisure or otherwise \\n(for instance, public roads and squares, parks, forests, playgrounds). A place should be \\nclassified as publicly accessible also if, regardless of potential capacity or security \\nrestrictions, access is subject to certain predetermined conditions, which can be fulfilled by \\nan undetermined number of persons, such as purchase of a ticket or title of transport, prior \\nregistration or having a certain age. By contrast, a place should not be considered publicly \\naccessible if access is limited to specific and defined natural persons through either Union \\nor national law directly related to public safety or security or through the clear \\nmanifestation of will by the person having the relevant authority on the place. The factual \\npossibility of access alone (e.g. an unlocked door, an open gate in a fence) does not imply \\nthat the place is publicly accessible in the presence of indications or circumstances \\nsuggesting the contrary (e.g. signs prohibiting or restricting access). Company and factory \\npremises as well as offices and workplaces that are intended to be accessed only by \\nrelevant employees and service providers are places that are not publicly accessible. \\nPublicly accessible spaces should not include prisons or border control. Some other areas \\nmay be composed of both not publicly accessible and publicly accessible areas, such as the \\nhallway of a private residential building necessary to access a doctor\\'s office or an airport. \\nOnline spaces are not covered either, as they are not physical spaces. Whether a given \\nspace is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case-by-case basis, \\nhaving regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand. \\n(9b) \\nIn order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental \\nrights, health and safety and to enable democratic control, AI literacy should equip \\nproviders, deployers and affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed \\ndecisions regarding AI systems. These notions may vary with regard to the relevant context \\nand can include understanding the correct application of technical elements during the AI \\nsystem’s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the suitable ways in \\nwhich to interpret the AI system’s output, and, in the case of affected persons, the \\nknowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the assistance of AI will \\nimpact them. In the context of the application this Regulation, AI literacy should provide \\nall relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights required to ensure the appropriate \\ncompliance and its correct enforcement. Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI \\nliteracy measures and the introduction of appropriate follow-up actions could contribute to \\nimproving working conditions and ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation \\npath of trustworthy AI in the Union. The European Artificial Intelligence Board should \\nsupport the Commission, to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding \\nof the benefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems. \\nIn cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States \\nshould facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy \\namong persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI. \\n(10) \\nIn order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of \\nindividuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to \\nproviders of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are \\nestablished within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems \\nestablished within the Union.  \\n(11) \\nIn light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this \\nRegulation even when they are neither placed on the market, nor put into service, nor used \\nin the Union. This is the case for example of an operator established in the Union that \\ncontracts certain services to an operator established outside the Union in relation to an \\nactivity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk. In those \\ncircumstances, the AI system used by the operator outside the Union could process data \\nlawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting \\noperator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without \\nthat AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To \\nprevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of \\nnatural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and \\ndeployers of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output \\nproduced by those systems is intended to be used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into \\naccount existing arrangements and special needs for future cooperation with foreign \\npartners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not \\napply to public authorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in \\nthe framework of cooperation or international agreements concluded at national or \\nEuropean level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or with its \\nMember States, under the condition that this third country or international organisations \\nprovide adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and \\nfreedoms of individuals. Where relevant, this may also cover activities of entities entrusted \\nby the third countries to carry out specific tasks in support of such law enforcement and \\njudicial cooperation. Such framework for cooperation or agreements have been established \\nbilaterally between Member States and third countries or between the European Union, \\nEuropol and other EU agencies and third countries and international organisations. The \\nauthorities competent for supervision of the law enforcement and judicial authorities under \\nthe AI Act should assess whether these frameworks for cooperation or international \\nagreements include adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental \\nrights and freedoms of individuals.  Recipient Member States authorities and Union \\ninstitutions, offices and bodies making use of such outputs in the Union remain \\naccountable to ensure their use complies with Union law. When those international \\nagreements are revised or new ones are concluded in the future, the contracting parties \\nshould undertake the utmost effort to align those agreements with the requirements of this \\nRegulation. \\n(12) \\nThis Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, offices, bodies and agencies when \\nacting as a provider or deployer of an AI system. \\n(12a) \\nIf and insofar AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or \\nwithout modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes, \\nthose should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation regardless of which type of \\nentity is carrying out those activities, such as whether it is a public or private entity. As \\nregards military and defence purposes, such exclusion is justified both by Article 4(2) TEU \\nand by the specificities of the Member States’ and the common Union defence policy \\ncovered by Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) that are subject to \\npublic international law, which is therefore the more appropriate legal framework for the \\nregulation of AI systems in the context of the use of lethal force and other AI systems in \\nthe context of military and defence activities. As regards national security purposes, the \\nexclusion is justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility \\nof Member States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and \\noperational needs of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to \\nthose activities. Nonetheless, if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into \\nservice or used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those \\ntemporarily or permanently for other purposes (for example, civilian or humanitarian \\npurposes, law enforcement or public security purposes), such a system would fall within \\nthe scope of this Regulation. In that case, the entity using the system for other than \\nmilitary, defence or national security purposes should ensure compliance of the system \\nwith this Regulation, unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI \\nsystems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded (i.e. military, defence or \\nnational security) and one or more non excluded purposes (e.g. civilian purposes, law \\nenforcement, etc.), fall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems \\nshould ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those cases, the fact that an AI system \\nmay fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of entities \\ncarrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of \\nentity carrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and \\ndefence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this Regulation. An AI \\nsystem placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes which is used with \\nor without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall \\nwithin the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those \\nactivities. \\n(12c)  This Regulation should support innovation, respect freedom of science, and should not \\nundermine research and development activity. It is therefore necessary to exclude from its \\nscope AI systems and models specifically developed and put into service for the sole \\npurpose of scientific research and development. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that the \\nRegulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and development activity on AI \\nsystems or models prior to being placed on the market or put into service. As regards \\nproduct oriented research, testing and development activity regarding AI systems or \\nmodels, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply prior to these systems and \\nmodels being put into service or placed on the market. This is without prejudice to the \\nobligation to comply with this Regulation when an AI system falling into the scope of this \\nRegulation is placed on the market or put into service as a result of such research and \\ndevelopment activity and to the application of provisions on regulatory sandboxes and \\ntesting in real world conditions. Furthermore, without prejudice to the foregoing regarding \\nAI systems specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific \\nresearch and development, any other AI system that may be used for the conduct of any \\nresearch and development activity should remain subject to the provisions of this \\nRegulation. Under all circumstances, any research and development activity should be \\ncarried out in accordance with recognised ethical and professional standards for scientific \\nresearch and should be conducted according to applicable Union law. \\n(14) \\nIn order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a \\nclearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the \\ntype and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can \\ngenerate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable artificial intelligence \\npractices, to lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the \\nrelevant operators, and to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems. \\n(14a)  While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding \\nrules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by \\nthe independent High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) appointed by the Commission. \\nIn those Guidelines the HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI \\nwhich should help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles \\ninclude: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data \\ngovernance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and \\nenvironmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally binding \\nrequirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, these Guidelines   \\ncontribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric Artificial \\nIntelligence, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. \\nAccording to the Guidelines of HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems \\nare developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal \\nautonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and \\noverseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed \\nand used in a way that allows robustness in case of problems and resilience against \\nattempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by \\nthird parties, and minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI \\nsystems are developed and used in compliance with existing privacy and data protection \\nrules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. \\nTransparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows \\nappropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they \\ncommunicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the \\ncapabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. \\nDiversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used \\nin a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and \\ncultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are \\nprohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI \\nsystems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as \\nwell as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term \\nimpacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of these principles \\nshould be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They should in \\nany case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation.  All \\nstakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, \\nare encouraged to take into account as appropriate the ethical principles for the \\ndevelopment of voluntary best practices and standards.  \\n(15) \\nAside from the many beneficial uses of artificial intelligence, that technology can also be \\nmisused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social \\ncontrol practices. Such practices are particularly harmful and abusive and should be \\nprohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, \\nequality, democracy and the rule of law and Union fundamental rights, including the right \\nto non-discrimination, data protection and privacy and the rights of the child. \\n(16) \\nAI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in \\nunwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that \\nsubverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on the \\nmarket, putting into service or use of certain AI systems with the objective to or the effect \\nof materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in particular having \\nsufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health or financial \\ninterests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should therefore be forbidden. \\nSuch AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, image, video stimuli that \\npersons cannot perceive as those stimuli are beyond human perception or other \\nmanipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s autonomy, decision-\\nmaking or free choices in ways that people are not consciously aware of, or even if aware  \\nthey are still deceived or not able to control or resist. This could be for example, facilitated \\nby machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of \\nwhat stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may be materially distorting their \\nbehaviour in a significantly harmful manner.  In addition, AI systems may also otherwise \\nexploit vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability \\nwithin the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882, or a specific social or economic situation \\nthat is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living \\nin extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the \\nmarket, put into service or used with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting \\nthe behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause    \\nsignificant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may \\nbe accumulated over time and should therefore be prohibited. The intention to distort the \\nbehaviour may not be presumed if the distortion results from factors external to the AI \\nsystem which are outside of the control of the provider or the deployer, meaning factors \\nthat may not be reasonably foreseen and mitigated by the provider or the deployer of the \\nAI system. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the \\nintention to cause significant harm, as long as such harm results from the manipulative or \\nexploitative AI-enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices are \\ncomplementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/29/EC, notably unfair \\ncommercial practices leading to economic or financial harms to consumers are prohibited \\nunder all circumstances, irrespective of whether they are put in place through AI systems \\nor otherwise.  The prohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this \\nRegulation should not affect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as \\npsychological treatment of a mental disease or physical rehabilitation, when those practices \\nare carried out in accordance with the applicable legislation and medical standards, for \\nexample explicit consent of the individuals or their legal representatives. In addition, \\ncommon and legitimate commercial practices, for example in the field of advertising, that \\nare in compliance with the applicable law should not in themselves be regarded as \\nconstituting harmful manipulative AI practices. \\n(16a)  Biometric categorisation systems that are based on individuals’ biometric data, such as an \\nindividual person’s face or fingerprint, to deduce or infer an individuals’ political opinions, \\ntrade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, race, sex life or sexual \\norientation should be prohibited. This prohibition does not cover the lawful labelling, \\nfiltering or categorisation of biometric datasets acquired in line with Union or national law \\naccording to biometric data, such as the sorting of images according to hair colour or eye \\ncolour, which can for example be used in the area of law enforcement. \\n(17) \\nAI systems providing social scoring of natural persons by public or private actors may lead \\nto discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the right \\nto dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI systems \\nevaluate or classify natural persons or groups thereof based on multiple data points related \\nto their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known, inferred or predicted personal or \\npersonality characteristics over certain periods of time. The social score obtained from \\nsuch AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons \\nor whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in which the \\ndata was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is \\ndisproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. AI systems entailing \\nsuch unacceptable scoring practices leading to such detrimental or unfavourable outcomes \\nshould be therefore prohibited. This prohibition should not affect lawful evaluation \\npractices of natural persons done for a specific purpose in compliance with national and \\nUnion law. \\n(18) \\nThe use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in \\npublicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to \\nthe rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the \\nprivate life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and \\nindirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights.  \\nTechnical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of \\nnatural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is \\nparticularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, \\nthe immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections \\nin relation to the use of such systems operating in ‘real-time’ carry heightened risks for the \\nrights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities.  \\n(19) \\nThe use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be \\nprohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is \\nstrictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which \\noutweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime \\nincluding missing people; certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or \\nof a terrorist attack; and the  localisation or identification  of perpetrators or suspects of the \\ncriminal offences referred to in Annex IIa  if those criminal offences are punishable in the \\nMember State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum \\nperiod of at least  four years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such \\nthreshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law \\ncontributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use \\nof ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems. Moreover, the list of criminal \\noffences as referred in Annex IIa is based on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council \\nFramework Decision 2002/584/JHA9, taking into account that some are in practice likely \\nto be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric \\n                                                 \\nidentification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for \\nthe practical pursuit of the  localisation or identification  of a perpetrator or suspect of the \\ndifferent criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the \\nseriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences.  \\nAn imminent threat to life or physical safety of natural persons could also result from a \\nserious disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (a) of Directive \\n2008/114/EC, where the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would \\nresult in an imminent threat to life or physical safety of a person, including through serious \\nharm to the provision of basic supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core \\nfunction of the State.  \\nIn addition, this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control, \\nimmigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the person \\nthat is concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law for \\nsuch checks. In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum \\nauthorities should be able to use information systems, in accordance with Union or national \\nlaw, to identify a person who, during an identity check, either refuses to be identified or is \\nunable to state or prove his or her identity, without being required by this Regulation to \\nobtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved in a crime, being \\nunwilling, or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to disclose their identity to \\nlaw enforcement authorities.  \\n(20) \\nIn order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it \\nis also important to establish that, in each of those  exhaustively listed and narrowly \\ndefined situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards \\nthe nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the \\nrights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided \\nfor with the use. In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems \\nin publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should only be deployed \\nto confirm the specifically target individual’s identity and should be limited to what is \\nstrictly necessary concerning the period of time as well as geographic and personal scope, \\nhaving regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims \\nor perpetrator. The use of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly \\naccessible spaces should only be authorised if the law enforcement authority has completed \\na fundamental rights impact assessment and, unless provided otherwise in this Regulation, \\nhas registered the system in the database as set out in this Regulation. The reference \\ndatabase of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the situations \\nmentioned above.  \\n(21) \\nEach use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible \\nspaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific \\nauthorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority whose \\ndecision is binding of a Member State. Such authorisation should in principle be obtained \\nprior to the use of the system with a view to identify a person or persons. Exceptions to this \\nrule should be allowed in duly justified situations of urgency, that is, situations where the \\nneed to use the systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively \\nimpossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use. In such situations of \\nurgency, the use should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be subject to \\nappropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the \\ncontext of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In \\naddition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations   request such \\nauthorisation whilst providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, \\nwithout undue delay and, at the latest within 24 hours.  If such authorisation is rejected, the \\nuse of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation should be \\nstopped with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be discarded and \\ndeleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system in the course of \\nthe use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use linked to that \\nauthorisation. It should not include input legally acquired in accordance with another \\nnational or Union law.  In any case, no decision producing an adverse legal effect on a \\nperson may be taken solely based on the output of the remote biometric identification \\nsystem. \\n(21a) \\nIn order to carry out their tasks in accordance with the requirements set out in this \\nRegulation as well as in national rules, the relevant market surveillance authority and the \\nnational data protection authority should be notified of each use of the ‘real-time biometric \\nidentification system’. National market surveillance authorities and the national data \\nprotection authorities that have been notified should submit to the Commission an annual \\nreport on the use of ‘real-time biometric identification systems’.  \\n(22) \\nFurthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this \\nRegulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this \\nRegulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State in question has \\ndecided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its detailed rules of \\nnational law. Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to \\nprovide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of \\nsome of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation. \\nThese national rules should be notified to the Commission at the latest 30 days following \\ntheir adoption.  \\n(23) \\nThe use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in \\npublicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the \\nprocessing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain \\nexceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in \\nrespect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive \\n(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in \\nan exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should only be possible in as far \\nas it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, \\noutside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law \\nenforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the \\ngrounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In this context, this Regulation is \\nnot intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 \\nof Directive 2016/680. However, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification \\nsystems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including \\nby competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such \\nuse for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other \\nthan law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation \\nunder this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect \\nto it. \\n(24) \\nAny processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems \\nfor biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of ‘real-time’ remote \\nbiometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law \\nenforcement as regulated by this Regulation, should continue to comply with all \\nrequirements resulting from Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680.  For purposes other \\nthan law enforcement, Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(1) of \\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1725 prohibit the processing of biometric data subject to limited \\nexceptions as provided in those articles. In application of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) \\n2016/679, the use of remote biometric identification for purposes other than law \\nenforcement has already been subject to prohibition decisions by national data protection \\nauthorities.  \\n(25) \\nIn accordance with Article 6a of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom \\nand Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, as annexed to the TEU \\nand to the TFEU, Ireland is not bound by the rules laid down in Article 5(1), point (d), (2), \\n(3), (3a), (4) and (5), Article 5(1)(ba) to the extent it applies to the use of biometric \\ncategorisation systems for activities in the field of police cooperation and judicial \\ncooperation in criminal matters, Article 5(1)(da) to the extent it applies to the use of AI \\nsystems covered by that provision and Article 29(6a) of this Regulation adopted on the \\nbasis of Article 16 of the TFEU which relate to the processing of personal data by the \\nMember States when carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter 4 or \\nChapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU, where Ireland is not bound by the rules \\ngoverning the forms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters or police cooperation \\nwhich require compliance with the provisions laid down on the basis of Article 16 of the \\nTFEU. \\n(26) \\nIn accordance with Articles 2 and 2a of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, \\nannexed to the TEU and TFEU, Denmark is not bound by rules laid down in Article 5(1), \\npoint (d), (2), (3), (3a), (4) and (5), Article 5(1)(ba) to the extent it applies to the use of \\nbiometric categorisation systems for activities in the field of police cooperation and \\njudicial cooperation in criminal matters, Article 5(1)(da) to the extent it applies to the use \\nof AI systems covered by that provision and Article 29(6a) of this Regulation adopted on \\nthe basis of Article 16 of the TFEU, or subject to their application, which relate to the \\nprocessing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities falling \\nwithin the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU. \\n(26a) \\nIn line with the presumption of innocence, natural persons in the EU should always be \\njudged on their actual behaviour. Natural persons should never be judged on AI-predicted \\nbehaviour based solely on their profiling, personality traits or characteristics, such as \\nnationality, place of birth, place of residence, number of children, debt, their type of car, \\nwithout a reasonable suspicion of that person being involved in a criminal activity based on \\nobjective verifiable facts and without human assessment thereof. Therefore, risk \\nassessments of natural persons in order to assess the risk of them offending or for \\npredicting the occurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence solely based on the \\nprofiling of a natural person or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics \\nshould be prohibited. In any case, this prohibition does not refer to nor touch upon risk \\nanalytics that are not based on the profiling of individuals or on the personality traits and \\ncharacteristics of individuals, such as AI systems using risk analytics to assess the risk of \\nfinancial fraud by undertakings based on suspicious transactions or risk analytic tools to \\npredict the likelihood of localisation of narcotics or illicit goods by customs authorities, for \\nexample based on known trafficking routes. \\n(26b)  The placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of AI \\nsystems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted scraping \\nof facial images from the internet or CCTV footage should be prohibited, as this practice \\nadds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross violations of fundamental \\nrights, including the right to privacy. \\n(26c)  There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or \\ninfer emotions, particularly as expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures \\nand situations, and even within a single individual. Among the key shortcomings of such \\nsystems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalizability. \\nTherefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on \\nthe basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive \\nto the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power \\nin the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems, \\nsuch systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons \\nor whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, putting into service, or use \\nof AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations \\nrelated to the workplace and education should be prohibited. This prohibition should not \\ncover AI systems placed on the market strictly for medical or safety reasons, such as \\nsystems intended for therapeutical use.  \\n(26d) \\nPractices that are prohibited by Union legislation, including data protection law, non-\\ndiscrimination law, consumer protection law, and competition law, should not be affected \\nby this Regulation. \\n(27) \\nHigh-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used \\nif they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure \\nthat high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the \\nUnion do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and \\nprotected by Union law. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified \\nin Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 \\n(C/2022/3637) the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation, such as \\nRegulation (EU) 2017/745 on Medical Devices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on In Vitro \\nDiagnostic Devices or Directive 2006/42/EC on Machinery, may have to be taken into \\nconsideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only \\ntake place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. \\nTo ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a \\nproduct that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the \\nrequirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation \\nlegislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational \\ndecisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial \\nintelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation \\nin a best way. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a \\nsignificant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the \\nUnion and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade, if any.  \\n(28) \\nAI systems could have an adverse impact to health and safety of persons, in particular \\nwhen such systems operate as safety components of products. Consistently with the \\nobjectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in \\nthe internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their \\nway into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product \\nas a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and \\nmitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of \\nmanufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and \\nperforms their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the \\nstakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics \\nsystems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate.  \\n(28a)  The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights \\nprotected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as high-\\nrisk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life, \\nprotection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly \\nand of association, and non-discrimination, right to education consumer protection, \\nworkers’ rights, rights of persons with disabilities, gender equality, intellectual property \\nrights, right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, right of defence and the presumption \\nof innocence, right to good administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to \\nhighlight that children have specific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the EU Charter and \\nin the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (further elaborated in the \\nUNCRC General Comment No. 25 as regards the digital environment), both of which \\nrequire consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection and \\ncare as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of \\nenvironmental protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies \\nshould also be considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can \\ncause, including in relation to the health and safety of persons. \\n(29) \\nAs regards high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products or systems, or \\nwhich are themselves products or systems falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No \\n300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council10, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 \\nof the European Parliament and of the Council11, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the \\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council12, Directive 2014/90/EU of the European \\nParliament and of the Council13, Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and \\nof the Council14, Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil15, Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council16, \\n                                                 \\nand Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council17, it is \\nappropriate to amend those acts to ensure that the Commission takes into account, on the \\nbasis of the technical and regulatory specificities of each sector, and without interfering \\nwith existing governance, conformity assessment and enforcement mechanisms and \\nauthorities established therein, the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems laid \\ndown in this Regulation when adopting any relevant future delegated or implementing acts \\non the basis of those acts. \\n(30) \\nAs regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves \\nproducts, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in \\nAnnex II, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this Regulation if the product \\nin question undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a third-party conformity \\nassessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation legislation. In particular, \\nsuch products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective systems intended for use \\nin potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure equipment, recreational \\ncraft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning gaseous fuels, medical devices, \\nand in vitro diagnostic medical devices. \\n(31) \\nThe classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not \\nnecessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI \\nsystem itself as a product, is considered ‘high-risk’ under the criteria established in the \\nrelevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is notably the \\ncase for Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council18 and \\n                                                                                                                                                                  \\nRegulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council19, where a third-\\nparty conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products. \\n(32) \\nAs regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than those that are \\nsafety components of products, or which are themselves products, it is appropriate to \\nclassify them as high-risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of \\nharm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both \\nthe severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a \\nnumber of specifically pre-defined areas specified in the Regulation. The identification of \\nthose systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future \\namendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be empowered \\nto adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of technological \\ndevelopment, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems. \\n(32a) \\nIt is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems referred \\nto pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk of harm to \\nthe legal interests protected under those areas, because they do not materially influence the \\ndecision-making or do not harm those interests substantially. For the purpose of this \\nRegulation an AI system not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making \\nshould be understood as an AI system that does not impact the substance, and thereby the \\noutcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated. This could be the case if one \\nor more of the following conditions are fulfilled. The first criterion should be that the AI \\nsystem is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that \\ntransforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming \\ndocuments into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large \\nnumber of applications. These tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose \\nonly limited risks which are not increased through the use in a context listed in Annex III. \\nThe second criterion should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to \\nimprove the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant for the \\npurpose of the use case listed in Annex III. Considering these characteristics, the AI system \\nonly provides an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. For \\nexample, this criterion would apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the \\nlanguage used in previously drafted documents, for instance in relation to professional \\n                                                 \\ntone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. The third \\ncriterion should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or \\ndeviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use \\nof the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant \\nto replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI systems include for \\ninstance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex \\npost whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential \\ninconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth criterion should be that the AI system is intended \\nto perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the \\nuse case listed in Annex III, thus making the possible impact of the output of the system \\nvery low in terms of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. For example, this \\ncriterion covers smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions from \\nindexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI \\nsystems used for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems referred to in \\nAnnex III should be considered to pose significant risks of harm to the health, safety or \\nfundamental rights of natural persons if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning \\nof Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 \\nand Article 3(5) of Regulation 2018/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a \\nprovider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk on the \\nbasis of the aforementioned criteria should draw up documentation of the assessment \\nbefore that system is placed on the market or put into service and should provide this \\ndocumentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such provider should be \\nobliged to register the system in the EU database established under this Regulation. With a \\nview to provide further guidance for the practical implementation of the criteria under \\nwhich AI systems referred to in Annex III are exceptionally not high-risk, the Commission \\nshould, after consulting the AI Board, provide guidelines specifying this practical \\nimplementation completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and \\nnon-high risk use cases of AI systems. \\n(33a)  As biometric data constitutes a special category of sensitive personal data, it is appropriate \\nto classify as high-risk several critical use-cases of biometric systems, insofar as their use \\nis permitted under relevant Union and national law. Technical inaccuracies of AI systems \\nintended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased \\nresults and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, \\nethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. Therefore, remote biometric identification systems \\nshould be classified as high-risk in view of the risks that they pose. This excludes AI \\nsystems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, \\nwhose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she \\nclaims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having \\naccess to a service, unlocking a device or having secure access to premises. \\nIn addition, AI systems intended to be used for biometric categorisation according to \\nsensitive attributes or characteristics protected under Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) \\n2016/679 based on biometric data, in so far as these are not prohibited under this \\nRegulation, and emotion recognition systems that are not prohibited under this Regulation, \\nshould be classified as high-risk. Biometric systems which are intended to be used solely \\nfor the purpose of enabling cybersecurity and personal data protection measures should not \\nbe considered as high-risk systems. \\n(34) \\nAs regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is appropriate to \\nclassify as high-risk the AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the \\nmanagement and operation of critical digital infrastructure as listed in Annex I point 8 of \\nthe Directive on the resilience of critical entities, road traffic and the supply of water, gas, \\nheating and electricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and \\nhealth of persons at large scale and lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct \\nof social and economic activities. Safety components of critical infrastructure, including \\ncritical digital infrastructure, are systems used to directly protect the physical integrity of \\ncritical infrastructure or health and safety of persons and property but which are not \\nnecessary in order for the system to function. Failure or malfunctioning of such \\ncomponents might directly lead to risks to the physical integrity of critical infrastructure \\nand thus to risks to health and safety of persons and property. Components intended to be \\nused solely for cybersecurity purposes should not qualify as safety components. Examples \\nof safety components of such critical infrastructure may include systems for monitoring \\nwater pressure or fire alarm controlling systems in cloud computing centres. \\n(35) \\nDeployment of AI systems in education is important to promote high-quality digital \\neducation and training and to allow all learners and teachers to acquire and share the \\nnecessary digital skills and competences, including media literacy, and critical thinking, to \\ntake an active part in the economy, society, and in democratic processes. However, AI \\nsystems used in education or vocational training, notably for determining access or  \\nadmission,  for assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or  \\nprogrammes at all levels, for evaluating learning outcomes of persons,  for assessing the \\nappropriate level of education for an individual and materially influencing the level of \\neducation and training that individuals will receive or be able to access or for monitoring \\nand detecting prohibited behaviour of students during tests should be classified as high-risk \\nAI systems, since they may determine the educational and professional course of a \\nperson’s life and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood. When improperly \\ndesigned and used, such systems can be particularly intrusive and may violate the right to \\neducation and training as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate \\nhistorical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, \\npersons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation.  \\n(36) \\nAI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self-employment, \\nnotably for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions affecting terms \\nof the work related relationship  promotion and termination of work-related contractual \\nrelationships for  allocating tasks based on individual behaviour, personal traits or \\ncharacteristics and for monitoring or evaluation of persons in work-related contractual \\nrelationships, should also be classified as high-risk, since those systems may appreciably \\nimpact future career prospects, livelihoods of these persons and workers’ rights. Relevant \\nwork-related contractual relationships should meaningfully involve employees and persons \\nproviding services through platforms as referred to in the Commission Work Programme \\n2021. Throughout the recruitment process and in the evaluation, promotion, or retention of \\npersons in work-related contractual relationships, such systems may perpetuate historical \\npatterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with \\ndisabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation. AI systems \\nused to monitor the performance and behaviour of these persons may also undermine their \\nfundamental rights to data protection and privacy.  \\n(37) \\nAnother area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to \\nand enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits necessary for \\npeople to fully participate in society or to improve one’s standard of living. In particular, \\nnatural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services \\nfrom public authorities namely healthcare services, social security benefits, social services \\nproviding protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or \\nold age and loss of employment and social and housing assistance, are typically dependent \\non those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible \\nauthorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services \\nshould be granted, denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, including whether \\nbeneficiaries are legitimately entitled to such benefits or services, those systems may have \\na significant impact on persons’ livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights, such \\nas the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human dignity or an effective remedy \\nand should therefore be classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, this Regulation should not \\nhamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration, \\nwhich would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided \\nthat those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons.  In addition, AI \\nsystems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural persons should be \\nclassified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons’ access to financial \\nresources or essential services such as housing, electricity, and telecommunication \\nservices. AI systems used for this purpose may lead to discrimination of persons or groups \\nand perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example based on racial or ethnic \\norigins, gender, disabilities, age, sexual orientation, or create new forms of discriminatory \\nimpacts. However, AI systems provided for by Union law for the purpose of detecting \\nfraud in the offering of financial services and for prudential purposes to calculate credit \\ninstitutions’ and insurances undertakings’ capital requirements should not be considered as \\nhigh-risk under this Regulation. Moreover, AI systems intended to be used for risk \\nassessment and pricing in relation to natural persons for health and life insurance can also \\nhave a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and if not duly designed, developed and \\nused, can infringe their fundamental rights and can lead to serious consequences for \\npeople’s life and health, including financial exclusion and discrimination. Finally, AI \\nsystems used to evaluate and classify emergency calls by natural persons or to dispatch or \\nestablish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services, including by \\npolice, firefighters and medical aid, as well as of emergency healthcare patient triage \\nsystems, should also be classified as high-risk since they make decisions in very critical \\nsituations for the life and health of persons and their property. \\n(38) \\nGiven their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving \\ncertain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance \\nand may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as \\nother adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the \\nAI system is not trained with high quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in \\nterms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested \\nbefore being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a \\ndiscriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of \\nimportant procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a \\nfair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be \\nhampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, \\nexplainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as \\ntheir use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems \\nintended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and \\ntransparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and \\nensure accountability and effective redress. In view of the nature of the activities in \\nquestion and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI systems should include in \\nparticular AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of law enforcement authorities or \\nby Union agencies, offices or bodies in support of law enforcement authorities for \\nassessing the risk of a natural person to become a victim of criminal offences, as \\npolygraphs and similar tools , for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in  in the \\ncourse of investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and, insofar not prohibited \\nunder this regulation, for assessing the risk of a natural person of offending or reoffending \\nnot solely based on profiling of natural persons nor based on  assessing personality traits \\nand characteristics or past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups, for profiling in \\nthe course of detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, . AI systems \\nspecifically intended to be used for administrative proceedings by tax and customs \\nauthorities as well as by financial intelligence units carrying out administrative tasks \\nanalysing information pursuant to Union anti-money laundering legislation should not be \\nclassified as high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of \\nprevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. The use of AI \\ntools by law enforcement and authorities should not become a factor of inequality, or \\nexclusion. The impact of the use of AI tools on the defence rights of suspects should not be \\nignored, notably the difficulty in obtaining meaningful information on the functioning of \\nthese systems and the consequent difficulty in challenging their results in court, in \\nparticular by individuals under investigation. \\n(39) \\nAI systems used in migration, asylum and border control management affect people who \\nare often in particularly vulnerable position and who are dependent on the outcome of the \\nactions of the competent public authorities. The accuracy, non-discriminatory nature and \\ntransparency of the AI systems used in those contexts are therefore particularly important \\nto guarantee the respect of the fundamental rights of the affected persons, notably their \\nrights to free movement, non-discrimination, protection of private life and personal data, \\ninternational protection and good administration. It is therefore appropriate to classify as \\nhigh-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law AI \\nsystems intended to be used by or on behalf of competent public authorities or by Union \\nagencies, offices or bodies charged with tasks in the fields of migration, asylum and border \\ncontrol management as polygraphs and similar tools, for assessing certain risks posed by \\nnatural persons entering the territory of a Member State or applying for visa or asylum, for \\nassisting competent public authorities for the examination, including  related assessment of \\nthe  reliability of evidence,  of applications for asylum, visa and residence permits and \\nassociated complaints with regard to the objective to establish the eligibility of the natural \\npersons applying for a status, for the purpose of detecting, recognising or identifying \\nnatural persons in the context of migration, asylum and border control management with \\nthe exception of travel documents. AI systems in the area of migration, asylum and border \\ncontrol management covered by this Regulation should comply with the relevant \\nprocedural requirements set by the Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and \\nof the Council20, the Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the \\nCouncil21 and other relevant legislation. The use of AI systems in migration, asylum and \\nborder control management should in no circumstances be used by Member States or \\nUnion institutions, agencies or bodies as a means to circumvent their international \\nobligations under the Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees as \\namended by the Protocol of 31 January 1967, nor should they be used to in any way \\ninfringe on the principle of non-refoulement, or deny safe and effective legal avenues into \\nthe territory of the Union, including the right to international protection. \\n(40) \\nCertain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes \\nshould be classified as high-risk, considering their potentially significant impact on \\ndemocracy, rule of law, individual freedoms as well as the right to an effective remedy and \\nto a fair trial. In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and opacity, it is \\nappropriate to qualify as high-risk AI systems intended to be used by a judicial authority or \\non its behalf to assist judicial authorities in researching and interpreting facts and the law \\nand in applying the law to a concrete set of facts. AI systems intended to be used by \\n                                                 \\nalternative dispute resolution bodies for those purposes should also be considered high-risk \\nwhen the outcomes of the alternative dispute resolution proceedings produce legal effects \\nfor the parties. The use of artificial intelligence tools can support the decision-making \\npower of judges or judicial independence, but should not replace it, as the final decision-\\nmaking must remain a human-driven activity and decision. Such qualification should not \\nextend, however, to AI systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that \\ndo not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation \\nor pseudonymisation of judicial decisions, documents or data, communication between \\npersonnel, administrative tasks. \\n(40a)  Without prejudice to the rules provided for in [Regulation xxx on the transparency and \\ntargeting of political advertising], and in order to address the risks of undue external \\ninterference to the right to vote enshrined in Article 39 of the Charter, and of adverse \\neffects on  democracy, and the rule of law, AI systems intended to be used to influence the \\noutcome of an election or referendum or the voting behaviour of natural persons in the \\nexercise of their vote in elections or referenda should be classified as high-risk AI systems \\nwith the exception of AI systems whose output natural persons are not directly exposed to, \\nsuch as tools used to organise, optimise and structure political campaigns from an \\nadministrative and logistical point of view.  \\n(41) \\nThe fact that an AI system is classified as a high-risk AI system under this Regulation \\nshould not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system is lawful under other acts \\nof Union law or under national law compatible with Union law, such as on the protection \\nof personal data, on the use of polygraphs and similar tools or other systems to detect the \\nemotional state of natural persons. Any such use should continue to occur solely in \\naccordance with the applicable requirements resulting from the Charter and from the \\napplicable acts of secondary Union law and national law. This Regulation should not be \\nunderstood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal data, including \\nspecial categories of personal data, where relevant, unless it is specifically provided for \\notherwise in this Regulation. \\n(42) \\nTo mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service \\nand to ensure a high level of trustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should apply \\nto high-risk AI systems, taking into account the intended purpose and the context of use of \\nthe AI system and according to the risk management system to be established by the \\nprovider. The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory \\nrequirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledge state \\nof the art on artificial intelligence, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of \\nthis Regulation. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in \\nCommission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 \\n(C/2022/3637), the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation may have to be \\ntaken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service \\ncan only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation \\nlegislation. Hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern \\ndifferent aspects than the existing Union harmonisation acts and therefore the requirements \\nof this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation acts. \\nFor example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might \\npresent risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the \\nrelevant Union harmonised legislation, as this sectoral legislation does not deal with risks \\nspecific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the \\nvarious legislative acts. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative \\nburden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial \\nintelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements \\nof the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a \\nflexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains \\none or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union \\nharmonised legislation in a best way. This flexibility could mean, for example a decision \\nby the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes, \\ninformation and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing \\ndocumentation and procedures required under the existing Union harmonisation legislation \\nlisted in Annex II, Section A. This however should not in any way undermine the \\nobligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements. \\n(42a)  The risk management system should consist of a continuous, iterative process that is \\nplanned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system. This process \\nshould be aimed at identifying and mitigating the relevant risks of artificial intelligence \\nsystems on health, safety and fundamental rights. The risk management system should be \\nregularly reviewed and updated to ensure its continuing effectiveness, as well as \\njustification and documentation of any significant decisions and actions taken subject to \\nthis Regulation. This process should ensure that the provider identifies risks or adverse \\nimpacts and implements mitigation measures for the known and reasonably foreseeable \\nrisks of artificial intelligence systems to the health, safety and fundamental rights in light \\nof its intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable misuse, including the possible risks \\narising from the interaction between the AI system and the environment within which it \\noperates. The risk management system should adopt the most appropriate risk management \\nmeasures in the light of the state of the art in AI. When identifying the most appropriate \\nrisk management measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made \\nand, when relevant, involve experts and external stakeholders. In identifying reasonably \\nforeseeable misuse of high-risk AI systems the provider should cover uses of the AI \\nsystems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in the \\ninstruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily \\npredictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of the \\nparticular AI system. Any known or foreseeable circumstances, related to the use of the \\nhigh-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of \\nreasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or \\nfundamental rights should be included in the instructions for use provided by the provider. \\nThis is to ensure that the deployer is aware and takes them into account when using the \\nhigh-risk AI system. Identifying and implementing risk mitigation measures for \\nforeseeable misuse under this Regulation should not require specific additional training \\nmeasures for the high-risk AI system by the provider to address them. The providers \\nhowever are encouraged to consider such additional training measures to mitigate \\nreasonable foreseeable misuses as necessary and appropriate.  \\n(43) \\nRequirements should apply to high-risk AI systems as regards risk management, the \\nquality and relevance of data sets used, technical documentation and record-keeping, \\ntransparency and the provision of information to deployers, human oversight, and \\nrobustness, accuracy and cybersecurity. Those requirements are necessary to effectively \\nmitigate the risks for health, safety and fundamental rights, and no other less trade \\nrestrictive measures are reasonably available, thus avoiding unjustified restrictions to trade.  \\n(44) \\nHigh quality data and access to high quality data plays a vital role in providing structure \\nand in ensuring the performance of many AI systems, especially when techniques \\ninvolving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high-risk AI \\nsystem performs as intended and safely and it does not become a source of discrimination \\nprohibited by Union law. High quality datasets for training, validation and testing require \\nthe implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. Datasets for \\ntraining, validation and testing, including the labels, should be relevant, sufficiently \\nrepresentative, and to the best extent possible free of errors and complete in view of the \\nintended purpose of the system. In order to facilitate compliance with EU data protection \\nlaw, such as   Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data governance and management practices \\nshould include, in the case of personal data, transparency about the original purpose of the \\ndata collection,  The datasets should also have the appropriate statistical properties, \\nincluding as regards the persons or groups of persons  in relation to whom the high-risk AI \\nsystem is intended to be used, with specific attention to the mitigation of possible biases in \\nthe datasets, that are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, negatively impact \\nfundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law, especially where \\ndata outputs influence inputs for future operations (‘feedback loops’) . Biases can for \\nexample be inherent in underlying datasets, especially when historical data is being used, \\nor generated when the systems are implemented in real world settings. Results provided by \\nAI systems could be influenced by such inherent biases that are inclined to gradually \\nincrease and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing discrimination, in particular for \\npersons belonging to certain vulnerable groups including racial or ethnic groups. The \\nrequirement for the datasets to be to the best extent possible complete and free of errors \\nshould not affect the use of privacy-preserving techniques in the context of the \\ndevelopment and testing of AI systems. In particular, datasets should take into account, to \\nthe extent required by their intended purpose, the features, characteristics or elements that \\nare particular to the specific geographical, contextual, behavioural or functional setting \\nwhich the AI system is intended to be used. The requirements related to data governance \\ncan be complied with by having recourse to third parties that offer certified compliance \\nservices including verification of data governance, data set integrity, and data training, \\nvalidation and testing practices, as far as compliance with the data requirements of this \\nRegulation are ensured.  \\n(45) \\nFor the development and assessment of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as \\nproviders, notified bodies and other relevant entities, such as digital innovation hubs, \\ntesting experimentation facilities and researchers, should be able to access and use high \\nquality datasets within their respective fields of activities which are related to this \\nRegulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the \\nfacilitation of data sharing between businesses and with government in the public interest \\nwill be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable and non-discriminatory access to high \\nquality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For example, in health, \\nthe European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and \\nthe training of artificial intelligence algorithms on those datasets, in a privacy-preserving, \\nsecure, timely, transparent and trustworthy manner, and with an appropriate institutional \\ngovernance. Relevant competent authorities, including sectoral ones, providing or \\nsupporting the access to data may also support the provision of high-quality data for the \\ntraining, validation and testing of AI systems.  \\n(45a)  The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout the \\nentire lifecycle of the AI system. In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and \\ndata protection by design and by default, as set out in Union data protection law, are \\napplicable when personal data are processed. Measures taken by providers to ensure \\ncompliance with those principles may include not only anonymisation and encryption, but \\nalso the use of technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allows \\ntraining of AI systems without the transmission between parties or copying of the raw or \\nstructured data themselves, without prejudice to the requirements on data governance \\nprovided for in this Regulation. \\n(44c) \\nIn order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from the \\nbias in AI systems, the providers  should, exceptionally, to the extent that it is strictly \\nnecessary for the purposes of ensuring bias detection and correction in relation to the high-\\nrisk AI systems, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms \\nof natural persons and following the application of all applicable conditions laid down \\nunder this Regulation in addition to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, \\nDirective (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725,be able to process also special \\ncategories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest within the meaning of \\nArticle 9(2)(g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(2)g) of Regulation (EU) \\n2018/1725. \\n(46) \\nHaving comprehensible information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed \\nand how they perform throughout their lifetime is essential to enable traceability of those \\nsystems, verify compliance with the requirements under this Regulation, as well as \\nmonitoring of their operations and post market monitoring. This requires keeping records \\nand the availability of a technical documentation, containing information which is \\nnecessary to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements and \\nfacilitate post market monitoring. Such information should include the general \\ncharacteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training, testing \\nand validation processes used as well as documentation on the relevant risk management \\nsystem and drawn in a clear and comprehensive form. The technical documentation should \\nbe kept up to date, appropriately throughout the lifetime of the AI system. Furthermore, \\nhigh risk AI systems should technically allow for automatic recording of events (logs) over \\nthe duration of the lifetime of the system. \\n(47) \\nTo address concerns related to opacity and complexity of certain AI systems and help \\ndeployers to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation, transparency should be required \\nfor high-risk AI systems before they are placed on the market or put it into service. High-\\nrisk AI systems should be designed in a manner to enable deployers to understand how the \\nAI system works, evaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and limitations. \\nHigh-risk AI systems should be accompanied by appropriate information in the form of \\ninstructions of use. Such information should include the characteristics, capabilities and \\nlimitations of performance of the AI system. These would cover information on possible \\nknown and foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high-risk AI system, \\nincluding deployer action that may influence system behaviour and performance, under \\nwhich the AI system can lead to risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights, on the \\nchanges that have been pre-determined and assessed for conformity by the provider and on \\nthe relevant human oversight measures, including the measures to facilitate the \\ninterpretation of the outputs of the AI system by the deployers. Transparency, including the \\naccompanying instructions for use, should assist deployers in the use of the system and \\nsupport informed decision making by them. Among others, deployers should be in a better \\nposition to make the correct choice of the system they intend to use in the light of the \\nobligations applicable to them, be educated about the intended and precluded uses, and use \\nthe AI system correctly and as appropriate. In order to enhance legibility and accessibility \\nof the information included in the instructions of use, where appropriate, illustrative \\nexamples, for instance on the limitations and on the intended and precluded uses of the AI \\nsystem, should be included. Providers should ensure that all documentation, including the \\ninstructions for use, contains meaningful, comprehensive, accessible and understandable \\ninformation, taking into account the needs and foreseeable knowledge of the target \\ndeployers. Instructions for use should be made available in a language which can be easily \\nunderstood by target deployers, as determined by the Member State concerned.  \\n(48) \\nHigh-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural persons \\ncan oversee their functioning, ensure that they are used as intended and that their impacts \\nare addressed over the system’s lifecycle. For this purpose, appropriate human oversight \\nmeasures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the \\nmarket or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should \\nguarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be \\noverridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the \\nnatural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary \\ncompetence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as appropriate, \\nto ensure that high-risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural \\nperson to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed decisions if, when \\nand how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop the system if \\nit does not perform as intended.  Considering the significant consequences for persons in \\ncase of incorrect matches by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to \\nprovide for an enhanced human oversight requirement for those systems so that no action \\nor decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from \\nthe system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural \\npersons. Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person \\noperating or using the system. This requirement should not pose unnecessary burden or \\ndelays and it could be sufficient that the separate verifications by the different persons are \\nautomatically recorded in the logs generated by the system. Given the specificities of the \\nareas of law enforcement, migration, border control and asylum, this requirement should \\nnot apply in cases where Union or national law considers the application of this \\nrequirement to be disproportionate.  \\n(49) \\nHigh-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an \\nappropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity, in the light of their intended \\npurpose and in accordance with the generally acknowledged state of the art.  The \\nCommission and relevant organisations and stakeholders are encouraged to take due \\nconsideration of mitigation of risks and negative impacts of the AI system. The expected \\nlevel of performance metrics should be declared in the accompanying instructions of use. \\nProviders are urged to communicate this information to deployers in a clear and easily \\nunderstandable way, free of misunderstandings or misleading statements.  The EU \\nlegislation on legal metrology, including on Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) and \\nNon-automatic weighing instruments (NAWI) Directive, aims to ensure the accuracy of \\nmeasurements and to help the transparency and fairness of commercial transactions. In this \\ncontext, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders and organisation, such as metrology and \\nbenchmarking authorities, the Commission should encourage, as appropriate, the \\ndevelopment of benchmarks and measurement methodologies for AI systems. In doing so, \\nthe Commission should take note and collaborate with international partners working on \\nmetrology and relevant measurement indicators relating to Artificial Intelligence. \\n(50) \\nThe technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be \\nresilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from \\nlimitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g. errors, \\nfaults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and organisational \\nmeasures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, for example by \\ndesigning and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or minimize harmful \\nor otherwise undesirable behaviour. Those technical solution may include for instance \\nmechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation (fail-safe plans) in the \\npresence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place outside certain predetermined \\nboundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively \\naffect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased \\noutputs generated by the AI system.  \\n(51) \\nCybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts \\nto alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by \\nmalicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI \\nsystems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or \\ntrained models (e.g. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit vulnerabilities \\nin the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of \\ncybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security controls, should \\ntherefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking into account as \\nappropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure. \\n(51a)  Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in  this \\nRegulation, high-risk AI systems which fall within the scope of the Regulation 2022/0272, \\nin accordance with Article 8 of the Regulation 2022/0272  may demonstrate compliance \\nwith the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation by fulfilling the essential \\ncybersecurity requirements set out in Article 10 and Annex I  of the Regulation \\n2022/0272.When high-risk AI systems fulfil the essential requirements of Regulation \\n2022/0272, they should be deemed compliant with the cybersecurity requirements set out \\nin this Regulation in so far as the achievement of those requirements is demonstrated in the \\nEU declaration of conformity or parts thereof issued under Regulation 2022/0272.  For this \\npurpose, the assessment of the cybersecurity risks, associated to a product with digital \\nelements classified as high-risk AI system according to this Regulation, carried out under \\nRegulation 2022/0272, should consider risks to the cyber resilience of an AI system as \\nregards attempts by unauthorised third parties to alter its use, behaviour or performance, \\nincluding AI specific vulnerabilities such as data poisoning or adversarial attacks, as well \\nas, as relevant, risks to fundamental rights as required by this Regulation. The conformity \\nassessment procedure provided by this Regulation should apply in relation to the essential \\ncybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements covered by Regulation \\n2022/0272 and classified as a high-risk AI system under this Regulation. However, this \\nrule should not result in reducing the necessary level of assurance for critical products with \\ndigital elements covered by Regulation 2022/0272. Therefore, by way of derogation from \\nthis rule, high-risk AI systems that fall within the scope of this Regulation and are also \\nqualified as important and critical products with digital elements pursuant to Regulation \\n2022/0272 and to which the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control \\nreferred to in Annex VI of this Regulation applies, are subject to the conformity \\nassessment provisions of Regulation 2022/0272 insofar as the essential cybersecurity \\nrequirements of Regulation 2022/0272 are concerned. In this case, for all the other aspects \\ncovered by this Regulation the respective provisions on conformity assessment based on \\ninternal control set out in Annex VI of this Regulation should apply. Building on the \\nknowledge and expertise of ENISA on the cybersecurity policy and tasks assigned to \\nENISA under the Regulation 2019/1020 the European Commission should cooperate with \\nENISA on issues related to cybersecurity of AI systems.  \\n(52) \\nAs part of Union harmonisation legislation, rules applicable to the placing on the market, \\nputting into service and use of high-risk AI systems should be laid down consistently with \\nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council22 setting out \\nthe requirements for accreditation and the market surveillance of products, Decision No \\n                                                 \\n768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council23 on a common framework \\nfor the marketing of products and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament \\nand of the Council24 on market surveillance and compliance of products (‘New Legislative \\nFramework for the marketing of products’). \\n(53) \\nIt is appropriate that a specific natural or legal person, defined as the provider, takes the \\nresponsibility for the placing on the market or putting into service of a high-risk AI system, \\nregardless of whether that natural or legal person is the person who designed or developed \\nthe system.  \\n(53a)  As signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \\n(UNCRPD), the Union and the Member States are legally obliged to protect persons with \\ndisabilities from discrimination and promote their equality, to ensure that persons with \\ndisabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to information and communications \\ntechnologies and systems, and to ensure respect for privacy for persons with disabilities. \\nGiven the growing importance and use of AI systems, the application of universal design \\nprinciples to all new technologies and services should ensure full and equal access for \\neveryone potentially affected by or using AI technologies, including persons with \\ndisabilities, in a way that takes full account of their inherent dignity and diversity. It is \\ntherefore essential that Providers ensure full compliance with accessibility requirements, \\nincluding Directive (EU) 2016/2102 and Directive (EU) 2019/882. Providers should ensure \\ncompliance with these requirements by design. Therefore, the necessary measures should \\nbe integrated as much as possible into the design of the high-risk AI system. \\n(54) \\nThe provider should establish a sound quality management system, ensure the \\naccomplishment of the required conformity assessment procedure, draw up the relevant \\ndocumentation and establish a robust post-market monitoring system. Providers of high-\\nrisk AI systems that are subject to obligations regarding quality management systems \\nunder relevant sectorial Union law should have the possibility to include the elements of \\nthe quality management system provided for in this Regulation as part of the existing \\nquality management system provided for in that other sectorial Union legislation. The \\n                                                 \\ncomplementarity between this Regulation and existing sectorial Union law should also be \\ntaken into account in future standardization activities or guidance adopted by the \\nCommission. Public authorities which put into service high-risk AI systems for their own \\nuse may adopt and implement the rules for the quality management system as part of the \\nquality management system adopted at a national or regional level, as appropriate, taking \\ninto account the specificities of the sector and the competences and organisation of the \\npublic authority in question.  \\n(56) \\nTo enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level-playing field for operators, and \\ntaking into account the different forms of making available of digital products, it is \\nimportant to ensure that, under all circumstances, a person established in the Union can \\nprovide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance of an AI system. \\nTherefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, providers established \\noutside the Union shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative \\nestablished in the Union.  This authorised representative plays a pivotal role in ensuring the \\ncompliance of the high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the \\nUnion by those providers who are not established in the Union and in serving as their \\ncontact person established in the Union.  \\n(56a) \\nIn the light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI systems and in line with \\nNew Legislative Framework principles, it is essential to ensure legal certainty and facilitate \\nthe compliance with this Regulation. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the role and the \\nspecific obligations of relevant operators along the value chain, such as importers and \\ndistributors who may contribute to the development of AI systems. In certain situations \\nthose operators could act in more than one role at the same time and should therefore fulfil \\ncumulatively all relevant obligations associated with those roles. For example, an operator \\ncould act as a distributor and an importer at the same time. \\n(57) \\nTo ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, \\nany distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party should be considered a provider of a \\nhigh-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations.  This would be the \\ncase if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the \\nmarket or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that \\nthe obligations are allocated otherwise, or if that party make a substantial modification to a \\nhigh-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into \\nservice and in a way that it remains a high-risk AI system in accordance with Article 6, or \\nif it modifies the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general purpose AI system,  \\nwhich  has not been classified as high-risk and  has already been placed on the market or \\nput into service, in a way that  the AI system becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance \\nwith Article 6. These provisions should apply without prejudice to more specific \\nprovisions established in certain New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation with \\nwhich this Regulation should apply jointly. For example, Article 16, paragraph 2 of \\nRegulation 745/2017, establishing that certain changes should not be considered \\nmodifications of a device that could affect its compliance with the applicable requirements, \\nshould continue to apply to high-risk AI systems that are medical devices within the \\nmeaning of that Regulation. \\n(57a)  General purpose AI systems may be used as high-risk AI systems by themselves or be \\ncomponents of other high risk AI systems. Therefore, due to their particular nature and in \\norder to ensure a fair sharing of responsibilities along the AI value chain, the providers of \\nsuch systems should, irrespective of whether they may be used as high-risk AI systems as \\nsuch by other providers or as components of high-risk AI systems and unless provided \\notherwise under this Regulation, closely cooperate with the providers of the respective \\nhigh-risk AI systems to enable their compliance with the relevant obligations under this \\nRegulation and with the competent authorities established under this Regulation.  \\n(57b)  Where, under the conditions laid down in this Regulation, the provider that initially placed \\nthe  AI system on the market or put it into service  should no longer be considered  the \\nprovider for the purposes of this Regulation, and when that provider has not expressly \\nexcluded the change of the AI system into a high-risk AI system, the former provider \\nshould nonetheless closely cooperate and make available the necessary information and \\nprovide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required for \\nthe fulfilment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in particular regarding the \\ncompliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems.  \\n(57c) \\nIn addition, where a high-risk AI system that is a safety component of a product which is \\ncovered by a relevant New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation is not placed on the \\nmarket or put into service independently from the product, the product manufacturer as \\ndefined under the relevant New Legislative Framework legislation should comply with the \\nobligations of the provider established in this Regulation and notably ensure that the AI \\nsystem embedded in the final product complies with the requirements of this Regulation.  \\n(57d)  Within the AI value chain multiple parties often supply AI systems, tools and services but \\nalso components or processes that are incorporated by the provider into the AI system with \\nvarious objectives, including the model training, model retraining, model testing and \\nevaluation, integration into software, or other aspects of model development.  These parties \\nhave an important role in the value chain towards the provider of the high-risk AI system \\ninto which their  AI systems, tools, services, components or processes are integrated, and \\nshould provide by written agreement this provider with the necessary information, \\ncapabilities, technical access and other assistance based on the generally acknowledged \\nstate of the art, in order to enable  the provider to fully comply with the obligations set out \\nin this Regulation, without compromising their own intellectual property rights or trade \\nsecrets. \\n(57e)  Third parties making accessible to the public tools, services, processes, or AI components \\nother than general-purpose AI models, shall not be mandated to comply with requirements \\ntargeting the responsibilities along the AI value chain, in particular towards the provider \\nthat has used or integrated them, when those tools, services, processes, or AI components \\nare made accessible under a free and open licence. Developers of free and open-source \\ntools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models should \\nbe encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards \\nand data sheets, as a way to accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, \\nallowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the Union.  \\n(57f) \\nThe Commission could develop and recommend voluntary model contractual terms \\nbetween providers of high-risk AI systems and third parties that supply tools, services, \\ncomponents or processes that are used or integrated in high-risk AI systems, to facilitate \\nthe cooperation along the value chain. When developing voluntary model contractual \\nterms, the Commission should also take into account possible contractual requirements \\napplicable in specific sectors or business cases.  \\n(58) \\nGiven the nature of AI systems and the risks to safety and fundamental rights possibly \\nassociated with their use, including as regards the need to ensure proper monitoring of the \\nperformance of an AI system in a real-life setting, it is appropriate to set specific \\nresponsibilities for deployers. Deployers should in particular take appropriate technical and \\norganisational measures to ensure they use high-risk AI systems in accordance with the \\ninstructions of use and certain other obligations should be provided for with regard to \\nmonitoring of the functioning of the AI systems and with regard to record-keeping, as \\nappropriate.  Furthermore, deployers should ensure that the persons assigned to implement \\nthe instructions for use and human oversight as set out in this Regulation have the \\nnecessary competence, in particular an adequate level of AI literacy, training and authority \\nto properly fulfil those tasks. These obligations should be without prejudice to other \\ndeployer obligations in relation to high-risk AI systems under Union or national law. \\n(58b)  This Regulation is without prejudice to obligations for employers to inform or to inform \\nand consult workers or their representatives under Union or national law and practice, \\nincluding directive 2002/14/EC on a general framework for informing and consulting \\nemployees, on decisions to put into service or use AI systems. It remains necessary to \\nensure information of workers and their representatives on the planned deployment of \\nhigh-risk AI systems at the workplace in cases where the conditions for those information \\nor information and consultation obligations in other legal instruments are not fulfilled. \\nMoreover, such information right is ancillary and necessary to the objective of protecting \\nfundamental rights that underlies this Regulation. Therefore, an information requirement to \\nthat effect should be laid down in this regulation, without affecting any existing rights of \\nworkers. \\n(58b)  Whilst risks related to AI systems can result from the way such systems are designed, risks \\ncan as well stem from how such AI systems are used. Deployers of high-risk AI system \\ntherefore play a critical role in ensuring that fundamental rights are protected, \\ncomplementing the obligations of the provider when developing the AI system. Deployers \\nare best placed to understand how the high-risk AI system will be used concretely and can \\ntherefore identify potential significant risks that were not foreseen in the development \\nphase, due to a more precise knowledge of the context of use, the people or groups of \\npeople likely to be affected, including vulnerable groups. Deployers of high-risk AI \\nsystems referred to in Annex III also play a critical role in informing natural persons and \\nshould, when they make decisions or assist in making decisions related to natural persons, \\nwhere applicable, inform the natural persons that they are subject to the use of the high risk \\nAI system. This information should include the intended purpose and the type of decisions \\nit makes. The deployer should also inform the natural person about its right to an \\nexplanation provided under this Regulation. With regard to high-risk AI systems used for \\nlaw enforcement purposes, this obligation should be implemented in accordance with \\nArticle 13 of Directive 2016/680.  \\n(58d)  Any processing of biometric data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric \\nidentification for the purpose of law enforcement needs to comply with Article 10 of \\nDirective (EU) 2016/680, that allows such processing only where strictly necessary, \\nsubject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and where \\nauthorised by Union or Member State law. Such use, when authorized, also needs to \\nrespect the principles laid down in Article 4 paragraph 1 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 \\nincluding lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage \\nlimitation. \\n(58e)  Without prejudice to applicable Union law, notably the GDPR and Directive (EU) \\n2016/680 (the Law Enforcement Directive), considering the intrusive nature of post remote \\nbiometric identification systems, the use of post remote biometric identification systems \\nshall be subject to safeguards. Post biometric identification systems should always be used \\nin a way that is proportionate, legitimate and strictly necessary, and thus targeted, in terms \\nof the individuals to be identified, the location, temporal scope and based on a closed \\ndataset of legally acquired video footage. In any case, post remote biometric identification \\nsystems should not be used in the framework of law enforcement to lead to indiscriminate \\nsurveillance. The conditions for post remote biometric identification should in any case not \\nprovide a basis to circumvent the conditions of the prohibition and strict exceptions for real \\ntime remote biometric identification. \\n(58g) \\nIn order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-risk \\nAI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private operators providing public \\nservices and operators deploying certain high-risk AI system referred to in Annex III, such \\nas banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment \\nprior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals that are of public nature may \\nalso be provided by private entities. Private operators providing such services of public \\nnature are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the area of education, healthcare, \\nsocial services, housing, administration of justice. The aim of the fundamental rights \\nimpact assessment is for the deployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of \\nindividuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in \\ncase of the materialisation of these risks. The impact assessment should apply to the first \\nuse of the high-risk AI system, and should be updated when the deployer considers that \\nany of the relevant factors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the \\ndeployer’s relevant processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its \\nintended purpose, and should include a description of the period of time and frequency in \\nwhich the system is intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons \\nand groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use. The assessment \\nshould also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to impact the \\nfundamental rights of these persons or groups. While performing this assessment, the \\ndeployer should take into account information relevant to a proper assessment of impact, \\nincluding but not limited to the information given by the provider of the high-risk AI \\nsystem in the instructions for use. In light of the risks identified, deployers should \\ndetermine measures to be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including for \\nexample governance arrangements in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for \\nhuman oversight according to the instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress \\nprocedures, as they could be instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in \\nconcrete use-cases.  After performing this impact assessment, the deployer should notify \\nthe relevant market surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant \\ninformation necessary to perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, \\nin particular when AI systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant \\nstakeholders, including the representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the \\nAI system, independent experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact \\nassessments and designing measures to be taken in the case of materialization of the risks. \\nThe AI Office should develop a template for a questionnaire in order to facilitate \\ncompliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers. \\n(60a)  The notion of general purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from the \\nnotion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the key \\nfunctional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality and \\nthe capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models are \\ntypically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-\\nsupervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General purpose AI models may be \\nplaced on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application \\nprogramming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models \\nmay be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential \\ncomponents of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models \\nrequire the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, to become \\nAI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI systems. This \\nRegulation provides specific rules for general purpose AI models and for general purpose \\nAI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are \\nintegrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the \\nproviders of general purpose AI models should apply once the general purpose AI models \\nare placed on the market. When the provider of a general purpose AI model integrates an \\nown model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, \\nthat model should be considered as being placed on the market and, therefore, the \\nobligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for \\nAI systems. The obligations foreseen for models should in any case not apply when an own \\nmodel is used for purely internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or \\na service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering \\ntheir potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic \\nrisk should always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The \\ndefinition should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole \\npurpose of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to \\nthe obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is \\nplaced on the market. \\n(60b)  Whereas the generality of a model could, among other criteria, also be determined by a \\nnumber of parameters, models with at least a billion of parameters and trained with a large \\namount of data using self-supervision at scale should be considered as displaying \\nsignificant generality and competently performing a wide range of distinctive tasks.  \\n(60c)  Large generative AI models are a typical example for a general-purpose AI model, given \\nthat they allow for flexible generation of content (such as in the form of text, audio, images \\nor video) that can readily accommodate a wide range of distinctive tasks. \\n(60d)  When a general-purpose AI model is integrated into or forms part of an AI system, this \\nsystem should be considered a general-purpose AI system when, due to this integration, \\nthis system has the capability to serve a variety of purposes. A general-purpose AI system \\ncan be used directly, or it may be integrated into other AI systems. \\n(60e) \\nProviders of general purpose AI models have a particular role and responsibility in the AI \\nvalue chain, as the models they provide may form the basis for a range of downstream \\nsystems, often provided by downstream providers that necessitate a good understanding of \\nthe models and their capabilities, both to enable the integration of such models into their \\nproducts, and to fulfil their obligations under this or other regulations. Therefore, \\nproportionate transparency measures should be foreseen, including the drawing up and \\nkeeping up to date of documentation, and the provision of information on the general \\npurpose AI model for its usage by the downstream providers. Technical documentation \\nshould be prepared and kept up to date by the general purpose AI model provider for the \\npurpose of making it available, upon request, to the AI Office and the national competent \\nauthorities. The minimal set of elements contained in such documentations should be \\noutlined, respectively, in Annex (IXb) and Annex (IXa). The Commission should be \\nenabled to amend the Annexes by delegated acts in the light of the evolving technological \\ndevelopments. \\n(60i) \\nSoftware and data, including models, released under a free and open-source licence that \\nallows them to be openly shared and where users can freely access, use, modify and \\nredistribute them or modified versions thereof, can contribute to research and innovation in \\nthe market and can provide significant growth opportunities for the Union economy.  \\nGeneral purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences should be \\nconsidered to ensure high levels of transparency and openness if their parameters, \\nincluding the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on \\nmodel usage are made publicly available.  The licence should be considered free and open-\\nsource also when it allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve \\nsoftware and data, including models under the condition that the original provider of the \\nmodel is credited, the identical or comparable terms of distribution are respected. \\n(60i+1) Free and open-source AI components covers the software and data, including models and \\ngeneral purpose AI models, tools, services or processes of an AI system. Free and open-\\nsource AI components can be provided through different channels, including their \\ndevelopment on open repositories. For the purpose of this Regulation, AI components that \\nare provided against a price or otherwise monetised, including through the provision of \\ntechnical support or other services, including through a software platform, related to the AI \\ncomponent, or the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the \\nsecurity, compatibility or interoperability of the software, with the exception of \\ntransactions between micro enterprises, should not benefit from the exceptions provided to \\nfree and open source AI components. The fact of making AI components available through \\nopen repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetisation. \\n(60f) \\nThe providers of general purpose AI models that are released under a free and open source \\nlicense, and whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the model \\narchitecture, and the information on model usage, are made publicly available should be \\nsubject to exceptions as regards the transparency-related requirements imposed on general \\npurpose AI models, unless they can be considered to present a systemic risk, in which case \\nthe circumstance that the model is transparent and accompanied by an open source license \\nshould not be considered a sufficient reason to exclude compliance with the obligations \\nunder this Regulation. In any case, given that the release of general purpose AI models \\nunder free and open source licence does not necessarily reveal substantial information on \\nthe dataset used for the training or fine-tuning of the model and on how thereby the respect \\nof copyright law was ensured,  the exception provided for general purpose AI models from \\ncompliance with the transparency-related requirements should not concern the obligation \\nto produce a summary about the content used for model training and the obligation to put \\nin place a policy to respect Union copyright law in particular to identify and respect the \\nreservations of rights expressed pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790. \\n(60i)  General purpose models, in particular large generative models, capable of generating text, \\nimages, and other content, present unique innovation opportunities but also challenges to \\nartists, authors, and other creators and the way their creative content is created, distributed, \\nused and consumed. The development and training of such models require access to vast \\namounts of text, images, videos, and other data. Text and data mining techniques may be \\nused extensively in this context for the retrieval and analysis of such content, which may \\nbe protected by copyright and related rights. Any use of copyright protected content \\nrequires the authorization of the rightholder concerned unless relevant copyright \\nexceptions and limitations apply. Directive (EU) 2019/790 introduced exceptions and \\nlimitations allowing reproductions and extractions of works or other subject matter, for the \\npurposes of text and data mining, under certain conditions. Under these rules, rightholders \\nmay choose to reserve their rights over their works or other subject matter to prevent text \\nand data mining, unless this is done for the purposes of scientific research. Where the \\nrights to opt out has been expressly reserved in an appropriate manner, providers of \\ngeneral-purpose AI models need to obtain an authorisation from rightholders if they want \\nto carry out text and data mining over such works.  \\n(60j) \\nProviders that place general purpose AI models on the EU market should ensure \\ncompliance with the relevant obligations in this Regulation. For this purpose, providers of \\ngeneral purpose AI models should put in place a policy to respect Union law on copyright \\nand related rights, in particular to identify and respect the reservations of rights expressed \\nby rightholders pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790. Any provider placing \\na general purpose AI model on the EU market should comply with this obligation, \\nregardless of the jurisdiction in which the copyright-relevant acts underpinning the training \\nof these general purpose AI models take place. This is necessary to ensure a level playing \\nfield among providers of general purpose AI models where no provider should be able to \\ngain a competitive advantage in the EU market by applying lower copyright standards than \\nthose provided in the Union.  \\n(60k) \\nIn order to increase transparency on the data that is used in the pre-training and training of \\ngeneral purpose AI models, including text and data protected by copyright law, it is \\nadequate that providers of such models draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently \\ndetailed summary of the content used for training the general purpose model. While taking \\ninto due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information, \\nthis summary should be generally comprehensive in its scope instead of technically \\ndetailed to facilitate parties with legitimate interests, including copyright holders, to \\nexercise and enforce their rights under Union law, for example by listing the main data \\ncollections or sets that went into training the model, such as large private or public \\ndatabases or data archives, and by providing a narrative explanation about other data \\nsources used. It is appropriate for the AI Office to provide a template for the summary, \\nwhich should be simple, effective, and allow the provider to provide the required summary \\nin narrative form.  \\n(60ka)  With regard to the obligations imposed on providers of general purpose AI models to put \\nin place a policy to respect Union copyright law and make publicly available a summary of \\nthe content used for the training, the AI Office should monitor whether the provider has \\nfulfilled those obligations without verifying or proceeding to a work-by-work assessment \\nof the training data in terms of copyright compliance. This Regulation does not affect the \\nenforcement of copyright rules as provided for under Union law. \\n(60g)  Compliance with the obligations foreseen for the providers of general purpose AI models \\nshould be commensurate and proportionate to the type of model provider, excluding the \\nneed for compliance for persons who develop or use models for non-professional or \\nscientific research purposes, who should nevertheless be encouraged to voluntarily comply \\nwith these requirements. Without prejudice to Union Copyright law, compliance with these \\nobligations should take due account of the size of the provider and allow simplified ways \\nof compliance for SMEs including start-ups, that should not represent an excessive cost \\nand not discourage the use of such models. In case of a modification or fine-tuning of a \\nmodel, the obligations for providers should be limited to that modification or fine-tuning, \\nfor example by complementing the already existing technical documentation with \\ninformation on the modifications, including new training data sources, as a means to \\ncomply with the value chain obligations provided in this Regulation. \\n(60m)  General purpose AI models could pose systemic risks which include, but are not limited to, \\nany actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects in relation to major accidents, \\ndisruptions of critical sectors and serious consequences to public health and safety; any \\nactual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, public and \\neconomic security; the dissemination of illegal, false, or discriminatory content. Systemic \\nrisks should be understood to increase with model capabilities and model reach, can arise \\nalong the entire lifecycle of the model, and are influenced by conditions of misuse, model \\nreliability, model fairness and model security, the degree of autonomy of the model, its \\naccess to tools, novel or combined modalities, release and distribution strategies, the \\npotential to remove guardrails and other factors. In particular, international approaches \\nhave so far identified the need to devote attention to risks from potential intentional misuse \\nor unintended issues of control relating to alignment with human intent; chemical, \\nbiological, radiological, and nuclear risks, such as the ways in which barriers to entry can \\nbe lowered, including for weapons development, design acquisition, or use; offensive \\ncyber capabilities, such as the ways in vulnerability discovery, exploitation, or operational \\nuse can be enabled; the effects of interaction and tool use, including for example the \\ncapacity to control physical systems and interfere with critical infrastructure; risks from \\nmodels of making copies of themselves or “self-replicating” or training other models; the \\nways in which models can give rise to harmful bias and discrimination with risks to \\nindividuals, communities or societies; the facilitation of disinformation or harming privacy \\nwith threats to democratic values and human rights; risk that a particular event could lead \\nto a chain reaction with considerable negative effects that could affect up to an entire city, \\nan entire domain activity or an entire community. \\n(60n) \\nIt is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general purpose AI \\nmodels as general purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from \\nparticularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI models should be considered to present \\nsystemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate \\ntechnical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its \\nreach. High-impact capabilities in general purpose AI models means capabilities that \\nmatch or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI \\nmodels. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its release \\non the market or when users interact with the model. According to the state of the art at the \\ntime of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of compute used for the \\ntraining of the general purpose AI model measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is \\none of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. The amount of compute used for \\ntraining cumulates the compute used across the activities and methods that are intended to \\nenhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic \\ndata generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of FLOPs should be set, \\nwhich, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a \\ngeneral-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time \\nto reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or \\nincreased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and \\nindicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the \\nscientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools \\nand benchmarks for the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors \\nof generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, \\nand could take into taking into account the way the model will be placed on the market or \\nthe number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility \\nfor the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as \\na general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has \\ncapabilities or impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. This decision \\nshould be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria set out in Annex YY, \\nsuch as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input \\nand output modalities, its degree of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. \\nUpon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-\\npurpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account \\nand may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered \\nto present systemic risks. \\n(60o) \\nIt is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general purpose AI \\nmodel with systemic risks. A general purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold \\nfor high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general purpose AI models with \\nsystemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the \\nrequirements are met or it becomes known that a general purpose AI model will meet the \\nrequirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the \\nFLOP threshold because training of general purpose AI models takes considerable \\nplanning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, \\nproviders of general purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the \\nthreshold before the training is completed. In the context of this notification, the provider \\nshould be able to demonstrate that because of its specific characteristics, a general purpose \\nAI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be \\nclassified as a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. This information is valuable \\nfor the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general purpose AI models with \\nsystemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. This is \\nespecially important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be \\nreleased as open-source, given that, after open-source model release, necessary measures to \\nensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to \\nimplement. \\n(60p) \\nIf the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general purpose AI model meets the \\nrequirements to classify as a general purpose model with systemic risk, which previously \\nhad either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to notify the \\nCommission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so. A system of \\nqualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of \\ngeneral-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as general purpose AI models \\nwith systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of the AI Office.  \\n(60q)  The providers of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, in \\naddition to the obligations provided for providers of general purpose AI models, to \\nobligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate level \\nof cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone model or \\nembedded in an AI system or a product. To achieve these objectives, the Regulation should \\nrequire providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in particular prior to its first \\nplacing on the market, including conducting and documenting adversarial testing of \\nmodels, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent external testing. In addition, \\nproviders of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should continuously assess \\nand mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting in place risk management \\npolicies, such as accountability and governance processes, implementing post-market \\nmonitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire model’s lifecycle and cooperating \\nwith relevant actors across the AI value chain.  \\n(60r) \\nProviders of general purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate \\npossible systemic risks.  If, despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a general \\npurpose AI model that may present systemic risks, the development or use of the model \\ncauses a serious incident, the general purpose AI model provider should without undue \\ndelay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible corrective \\nmeasures to the Commission and national competent authorities. Furthermore, providers \\nshould ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the model and its physical \\ninfrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. Cybersecurity protection \\nrelated to systemic risks associated with malicious use of or attacks should duly consider \\naccidental model leakage, unsanctioned releases, circumvention of safety measures, and \\ndefence against cyberattacks, unauthorised access or model theft. This protection could be \\nfacilitated by securing model weights, algorithms, servers, and datasets, such as through \\noperational security measures for information security, specific cybersecurity policies, \\nadequate technical and established solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, \\nappropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks involved.  \\n(60s) \\nThe AI Office should encourage and facilitate the drawing up, review and adaptation of \\nCodes of Practice, taking into account international approaches. All providers of general-\\npurpose AI models could be invited to participate. To ensure that the Codes of Practice \\nreflect the state of the art and duly take into account a diverse set of perspectives, the AI \\nOffice should collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where \\nappropriate, consult with civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders and \\nexperts, including the Scientific Panel, for the drawing up of the Codes. Codes of Practice \\nshould cover obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models and of general-\\npurpose models presenting systemic risks. In addition, as regards systemic risks, Codes of \\nPractice should help to establish a risk taxonomy of the type and nature of the systemic \\nrisks at Union level, including their sources. Codes of practice should also be focused on \\nspecific risk assessment and mitigation measures. \\n(60t) \\nThe Codes of Practice should represent a central tool for the proper compliance with the \\nobligations foreseen under this Regulation for providers of general-purpose AI models. \\nProviders should be able to rely on Codes of Practice to demonstrate compliance with the \\nobligations. By means of implementing acts, the Commission may decide to approve a \\ncode of practice and give it a general validity within the Union, or, alternatively, to provide \\ncommon rules for the implementation of the relevant obligations, if, by the time the \\nRegulation becomes applicable, a Code of Practice cannot be finalised or is not deemed \\nadequate by the AI Office. Once a harmonised standard is published and assessed as \\nsuitable to cover the relevant obligations by the AI Office, the compliance with a European \\nharmonised standard should grant providers the presumption of conformity. Providers of \\ngeneral purpose AI models should furthermore be able to demonstrate compliance using \\nalternative adequate means, if codes of practice or harmonized standards are not available, \\nor they choose not to rely on those.  \\n(60u)  This Regulation regulates AI systems and models by imposing certain requirements and \\nobligations for relevant market actors that are placing them on the market, putting into \\nservice or use in the Union, thereby complementing obligations for providers of \\nintermediary services that embed such systems or models into their services regulated by \\nRegulation (EU) 2022/2065. To the extent that such systems or models are embedded into \\ndesignated very large online platforms or very large online search engines, they are subject \\nto the risk management framework provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. \\nConsequently, the corresponding obligations of the AI Act should be presumed to be \\nfulfilled, unless significant systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 \\nemerge and are identified in such models. Within this framework, providers of very large \\nonline platforms and very large search engines are obliged to assess potential systemic \\nrisks stemming from the design, functioning and use of their services, including how the \\ndesign of algorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, as well as \\nsystemic risks stemming from potential misuses. Those providers are also obliged to take \\nappropriate mitigating measures in observance of fundamental rights. \\n(60aa)  Considering the quick pace of innovation and the technological evolution of digital \\nservices in scope of different instruments of Union law in particular having in mind the \\nusage and the perception of their recipients, the AI systems subject to this Regulation may \\nbe provided as intermediary services or parts thereof within the meaning of Regulation \\n(EU) 2022/2065, which should be interpreted in a technology-neutral manner. For \\nexample, AI systems may be used to provide online search engines, in particular, to the \\nextent that an AI system such as an online chatbot performs searches of, in principle, all \\nwebsites, then incorporates the results into its existing knowledge and uses the updated \\nknowledge to generate a single output that combines different sources of information. \\n(60v) \\nFurthermore, obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this \\nRegulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are \\nartificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective \\nimplementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the \\nobligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines \\nto identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that \\nhas been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable \\nnegative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including \\nthrough disinformation. \\n(61) \\nStandardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to ensure \\ncompliance with this Regulation, in line with the state of the art, to promote innovation as \\nwell as competitiveness and growth in the single market. Compliance with harmonised \\nstandards as defined in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of \\nthe Council25, which are normally expected to reflect the state of the art, should be a means \\nfor providers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of this Regulation. A \\nbalanced representation of interests involving all relevant stakeholders in the development \\nof standards, in particular SME’s, consumer organisations and environmental and social \\nstakeholders in accordance with Article 5 and 6 of Regulation 1025/2012 should therefore \\nbe encouraged.  In order to facilitate compliance, the standardisation requests should be \\nissued by the Commission without undue delay. When preparing the standardisation \\nrequest, the Commission should consult the AI advisory Forum and the Board in order to \\n                                                 \\ncollect relevant expertise. However, in the absence of relevant references to harmonised \\nstandards, the Commission should be able to establish, via implementing acts, and after \\nconsultation of the AI Advisory forum, common specifications for certain requirements \\nunder this Regulation. The common specification should be an exceptional fall back \\nsolution to facilitate the provider’s obligation to comply with the requirements of this \\nRegulation, when the standardisation request has not been accepted by any of the European \\nstandardisation organisations, or when the relevant harmonized standards insufficiently \\naddress fundamental rights concerns, or when the harmonised standards do not comply \\nwith the request, or when there are delays in the adoption of an appropriate harmonised \\nstandard. If such delay in the adoption of a harmonised standard is due to the technical \\ncomplexity of the standard in question, this should be considered by the Commission \\nbefore contemplating the establishment of common specifications.   When developing \\ncommon specifications, the Commission is encouraged to cooperate with international \\npartners and international standardisation bodies.  \\n(61a) \\nIt is appropriate that, without prejudice to the use of harmonised standards and common \\nspecifications, providers of high-risk AI system that has been trained and tested on data \\nreflecting the specific geographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within \\nwhich the AI system is intended to be used, should be presumed to be in compliance with \\nthe respective measure provided for under the requirement on data governance set out in \\nthis Regulation. Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy \\nset out in this Regulation, in line with Article 54(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the \\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council, high-risk AI systems that have been certified or \\nfor which a statement of conformity has been issued under a cybersecurity scheme \\npursuant to that Regulation and the references of which have been published in the Official \\nJournal of the European Union should be presumed to be in compliance with the \\ncybersecurity requirement of this Regulation in so far as the cybersecurity certificate or \\nstatement of conformity or parts thereof cover the cybersecurity requirement of this \\nRegulation  This remains without prejudice to the voluntary nature of that cybersecurity \\nscheme. \\n(62) \\nIn order to ensure a high level of trustworthiness of high-risk AI systems, those systems \\nshould be subject to a conformity assessment prior to their placing on the market or putting \\ninto service. \\n(63) \\nIt is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any possible \\nduplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by existing \\nUnion harmonisation legislation following the New Legislative Framework approach, the \\ncompliance of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be \\nassessed as part of the conformity assessment already foreseen under that legislation. The \\napplicability of the requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific \\nlogic, methodology or general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant \\nspecific New Legislative Framework legislation.  \\n(64) \\nGiven the complexity of high-risk AI systems and the risks that are associated to them, it is \\nimportant to develop an adequate system of conformity assessment procedure for high risk \\nAI systems involving notified bodies, so called third party conformity assessment. \\nHowever, given the current experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field of \\nproduct safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in \\nan initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third-party \\nconformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to products. \\nTherefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general \\nrule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems \\nintended to be used for biometrics. \\n(65) \\nIn order to carry out third-party conformity assessments when so required, notified bodies \\nshould be notified under this Regulation by the national competent authorities, provided \\nthey are compliant with a set of requirements, notably on independence, competence, \\nabsence of conflicts of interests and suitable cybersecurity requirements. Notification of \\nthose bodies should be sent by national competent authorities to the Commission and the \\nother Member States by means of the electronic notification tool developed and managed \\nby the Commission pursuant to Article R23 of Decision 768/2008.  \\n(65a) \\nIn line with Union commitments under the World Trade Organization Agreement on \\nTechnical Barriers to Trade, it is adequate to facilitate the mutual recognition of \\nconformity assessment results produced by competent conformity assessment bodies, \\nindependent of the territory in which they are established, provided that those conformity \\nassessment bodies established under the law of a third country meet the applicable \\nrequirements of the Regulation and the Union has concluded an agreement to that extent. \\nIn this context, the Commission should actively explore possible international instruments \\nfor that purpose and in particular pursue the conclusion of mutual recognition agreements \\nwith third countries. \\n(66) \\nIn line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification for products \\nregulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate that whenever a change \\noccurs which may affect the compliance of a high risk AI system with this Regulation (e.g. \\nchange of operating system or software architecture), or when the intended purpose of the \\nsystem changes, that AI system should be considered a new AI system which should \\nundergo a new conformity assessment. However, changes occurring to the algorithm and \\nthe performance of AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market \\nor put into service (i.e. automatically adapting how functions are carried out) should not \\nconstitute a substantial modification, provided that those changes have been pre-\\ndetermined by the provider and assessed at the moment of the conformity assessment. \\n(67) \\nHigh-risk AI systems should bear the CE marking to indicate their conformity with this \\nRegulation so that they can move freely within the internal market. For high-risk AI \\nsystems embedded in a product, a physical CE marking should be affixed, and may be \\ncomplemented by a digital CE marking. For high-risk AI systems only provided digitally, a \\ndigital CE marking should be used. Member States should not create unjustified obstacles \\nto the placing on the market or putting into service of high-risk AI systems that comply \\nwith the requirements laid down in this Regulation and bear the CE marking. \\n(68) \\nUnder certain conditions, rapid availability of innovative technologies may be crucial for \\nhealth and safety of persons, the protection of the environment and climate change and for \\nsociety as a whole. It is thus appropriate that under exceptional reasons of public security \\nor protection of life and health of natural persons, environmental protection and the \\nprotection of key industrial and infrastructural assets, market surveillance authorities could \\nauthorise the placing on the market or putting into service of AI systems which have not \\nundergone a conformity assessment. In a duly justified situations as provided under this \\nregulations, law enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a specific \\nhigh-risk AI system into service without the authorisation of the market surveillance \\nauthority, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use without \\nundue delay.  \\n(69) \\nIn order to facilitate the work of the Commission and the Member States in the artificial \\nintelligence field as well as to increase the transparency towards the public, providers of \\nhigh-risk AI systems other than those related to products falling within the scope of \\nrelevant existing Union harmonisation legislation, as well as providers who consider that \\nan AI system referred to in annex III is by derogation not high-risk, should be required to \\nregister themselves and information about their  AI system  in a EU database, to be \\nestablished and managed by the Commission. Before using a high-risk AI system listed in \\nAnnex III, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities, agencies or bodies, \\nshall register themselves in such database and select the system that they envisage to use.. \\nOther deployers should be entitled to do so voluntarily. This section of the database should \\nbe publicly accessible, free of charge, the information should be easily navigable, \\nunderstandable and machine-readable. The database should also be user-friendly, for \\nexample by providing search functionalities, including through keywords, allowing the \\ngeneral public to find relevant information included in Annex VIII and on the areas of risk \\nunder Annex III to which the high-risk AI systems correspond. Any substantial \\nmodification of high-risk AI systems should also be registered in the EU database. For \\nhigh risk AI systems in the area of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control \\nmanagement, the registration obligations should be fulfilled in a secure non-public section \\nof the database. Access to the secure non-public section should be strictly limited to the \\nCommission as well as to market surveillance authorities with regard to their national \\nsection of that database. High risk AI systems in the area of critical infrastructure should \\nonly be registered at national level. The Commission should be the controller of  the EU \\ndatabase, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and \\nof the Council26. In order to ensure the full functionality of the database, when deployed, \\nthe procedure for setting the database should include the elaboration of functional \\nspecifications by the Commission and an independent audit report. The Commission \\nshould take into account cybersecurity and hazard-related risks when carrying out its tasks \\nas data controller on the EU database. In order to maximise the availability and use of the \\ndatabase by the public, the database, including the information made available through it, \\nshould comply with requirements under the Directive 2019/882.  \\n(70) \\nCertain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content may \\npose specific risks of impersonation or deception irrespective of whether they qualify as \\nhigh-risk or not. In certain circumstances, the use of these systems should therefore be \\n                                                 \\nsubject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the requirements and \\nobligations for high-risk AI systems and subject to targeted exceptions to take into account \\nthe special need of law enforcement. In particular, natural persons should be notified that \\nthey are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a \\nnatural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect taking into \\naccount the circumstances and the context of use. When implementing such obligation, the \\ncharacteristics of individuals belonging to vulnerable groups due to their age or disability \\nshould be taken into account to the extent the AI system is intended to interact with those \\ngroups as well. Moreover, natural persons should be notified when they are exposed to \\nsystems that, by processing their biometric data, can identify or infer the emotions or \\nintentions of those persons or assign them to specific categories. Such specific categories \\ncan relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, personal traits, ethnic \\norigin, personal preferences and interests. Such information and notifications should be \\nprovided in accessible formats for persons with disabilities.  \\n(70a)  A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic content that becomes \\nincreasingly hard for humans to distinguish from human-generated and authentic content. \\nThe wide availability and increasing capabilities of those systems have a significant impact \\non the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new risks of misinformation \\nand manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In the light of \\nthose impacts, the fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to \\ntrace origin of information, it is appropriate to require providers of those systems to embed \\ntechnical solutions that enable marking in a machine readable format and detection that the \\noutput has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human. Such \\ntechniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust \\nas far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a \\ncombination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, \\ncryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging \\nmethods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate. When implementing this \\nobligation, providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of \\nthe different types of content and the relevant technological and market developments in \\nthe field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art. Such techniques and \\nmethods can be implemented at the level of the system or at the level of the model, \\nincluding general-purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of \\nthis obligation by the downstream provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is \\nappropriate to envisage that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems \\nperforming primarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not \\nsubstantially altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.  \\n(70b) \\nFurther to the technical solutions employed by the providers of the system, deployers , who \\nuse an AI system to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably \\nresembles existing persons, places or events and would falsely appear to a person to be \\nauthentic (‘deep fakes’), should also clearly and distinguishably disclose that the content \\nhas been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial intelligence output \\naccordingly and disclosing its artificial origin The compliance with this transparency \\nobligation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system or its output \\nimpedes the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of the arts and sciences \\nguaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, in particular where the content \\nis part of an evidently creative, satirical, artistic or fictional work or programme, subject to \\nappropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties. In those cases, the \\ntransparency obligation for deep fakes set out in this Regulation is limited to disclosure of \\nthe existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does \\nnot hamper the display or enjoyment of the work, including its normal exploitation and \\nuse, while maintaining the utility and quality of the work. In addition, it is also appropriate \\nto envisage a similar disclosure obligation in relation to AI-generated or manipulated text \\nto the extent it is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public \\ninterest unless the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or \\neditorial control and a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the \\npublication of the content.  \\n(70c)  To ensure consistent implementation, it is appropriate to empower the Commission to \\nadopt implementing acts on the application of the provisions on the labelling and detection \\nof artificially generated or manipulated content. Without prejudice to the mandatory nature \\nand full applicability of these obligations, the Commission may also encourage and \\nfacilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level to facilitate the effective \\nimplementation of the obligations regarding the detection and labelling of artificially \\ngenerated or manipulated content, including to support practical arrangements for making, \\nas appropriate, the detection mechanisms accessible and facilitating cooperation with other \\nactors in the value chain, disseminating content or checking its authenticity and \\nprovenance to enable the public to effectively distinguish AI-generated content.  \\n(70d)  The obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation \\nto enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially \\ngenerated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective implementation \\nof Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the obligations of \\nproviders of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and \\nmitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been \\nartificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable negative \\neffects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including through \\ndisinformation. The requirement to label content generated by AI systems under this \\nRegulation is without prejudice to the obligation in Article 16(6) of Regulation 2022/2065 \\nfor providers of hosting services to process notices on illegal content received pursuant to \\nArticle 16(1) and should not influence the assessment and the decision on the illegality of \\nthe specific content. That assessment should be performed solely with reference to the \\nrules governing the legality of the content. \\n(70e)  The compliance with the transparency obligations for the AI systems coved by this \\nRegulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system or its output is \\nlawful under this Regulation or other Union and Member State law and should be without \\nprejudice to other transparency obligations for deployers of AI systems laid down in Union \\nor national law. \\n(71) \\nArtificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires \\nregulatory oversight and a safe and controlled space for experimentation, while ensuring \\nresponsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation \\nmeasures. To ensure a legal framework that promotes innovation, is future-proof and \\nresilient to disruption, Member States should ensure that their national competent \\nauthorities establish at least one artificial intelligence regulatory sandbox at national level \\nto facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict regulatory \\noversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service. \\nMember States could also fulfil this obligation through participating in already existing \\nregulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly a sandbox with one or several Member States’ \\ncompetent authorities, insofar as this participation provides equivalent level of national \\ncoverage for the participating Member States. Regulatory sandboxes could be established \\nin physical, digital or hybrid form and may accommodate physical as well as digital \\nproducts. Establishing authorities should also ensure that the regulatory sandboxes have the \\nadequate resources for their functioning, including financial and human resources. \\n(72) \\nThe objectives of the AI regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by \\nestablishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and \\npre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI systems with \\nthis Regulation and other relevant Union and Member States legislation, to enhance legal \\ncertainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and understanding of the \\nopportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, to facilitate regulatory learning for \\nauthorities and companies, including with a view to future adaptions of the legal \\nframework,  to support cooperation and the sharing of best practices with the authorities \\ninvolved in the AI regulatory sandbox, and to accelerate access to markets, including by \\nremoving barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including start-ups. \\nRegulatory sandboxes should be widely available throughout the Union, and particular \\nattention should be given to their accessibility for SMEs, including startups. The \\nparticipation in the AI regulatory sandbox should focus on issues that raise legal \\nuncertainty for providers and prospective providers to innovate, experiment with AI in the \\nUnion and contribute to evidence-based regulatory learning. The supervision of the AI \\nsystems in the AI regulatory sandbox should therefore cover their development, training, \\ntesting and validation before the systems are placed on the market or put into service, as \\nwell as the notion and occurrence of substantial modification that may require a new \\nconformity assessment procedure. Any significant risks identified during the development \\nand testing of such AI systems should result in adequate mitigation and, failing that, in the \\nsuspension of the development and testing process  Where appropriate, national competent \\nauthorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes should cooperate with other relevant \\nauthorities, including those supervising the protection of fundamental rights,, and could \\nallow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem such as national or \\nEuropean standardisation organisations, notified bodies, testing and experimentation \\nfacilities, research and experimentation labs, European Digital innovation hubs and \\nrelevant stakeholder and civil society organisations. To ensure uniform implementation \\nacross the Union and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for \\nthe regulatory sandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between the \\nrelevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. AI regulatory sandboxes \\nestablished under this Regulation should be without prejudice to other legislation allowing \\nfor the establishment of other sandboxes aiming at ensuring compliance with legislation \\nother that this Regulation. Where appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of \\nthose other regulatory sandboxes should consider the benefits of using those sandboxes \\nalso for the purpose of ensuring compliance of AI systems with this Regulation. Upon \\nagreement between the national competent authorities and the participants in the AI \\nregulatory sandbox, testing in real world conditions may also be operated and supervised in \\nthe framework of the AI regulatory sandbox. \\n(72a)  This Regulation should provide the legal basis for the  providers and prospective providers \\nin the AI regulatory sandbox to use personal data collected for other purposes for \\ndeveloping certain AI systems in the public interest within the AI regulatory sandbox, only \\nunder specified conditions, in line with Article 6(4) and 9(2)(g) of Regulation (EU) \\n2016/679, and Article 5, 6 and 10 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, and without prejudice to \\nArticles 4(2) and 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. All other obligations of data controllers \\nand rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 \\nand Directive (EU) 2016/680 remain applicable. In particular, this Regulation should not \\nprovide a legal basis in the meaning of Article 22(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and \\nArticle 24(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.  Providers and prospective providers in the \\nsandbox should ensure appropriate safeguards and cooperate with the competent \\nauthorities, including by following their guidance and acting expeditiously and in good \\nfaith to adequately mitigate any identified - significant risks to safety, health,  and \\nfundamental rights that may arise during the development, testing and experimentation in \\nthe sandbox.  \\n(72b) \\nIn order to accelerate the process of development and placing on the market of high-risk AI \\nsystems listed in Annex III, it is important that providers or prospective providers of such \\nsystems may also benefit from a specific regime for testing those systems in real world \\nconditions, without participating in an AI regulatory sandbox. However, in such cases and \\ntaking into account the possible consequences of such testing on individuals, it should be \\nensured that appropriate and sufficient guarantees and conditions are introduced by the \\nRegulation for providers or prospective providers. Such guarantees should include, among \\nothers, requesting informed consent of natural persons to participate in testing in real world \\nconditions, with the exception of law enforcement in cases where the seeking of informed \\nconsent would prevent the AI system from being tested. Consent of subjects to participate \\nin such testing under this Regulation is distinct from and without prejudice to consent of \\ndata subjects for the processing of their personal data under the relevant data protection \\nlaw. It is also important to minimise the risks and enable oversight by competent \\nauthorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real-world testing plan \\nsubmitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated \\nsections in the EU-wide database subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the \\nperiod for which the testing can be done and require additional safeguards for persons \\nbelonging to certain vulnerable groups as well as a written agreement defining the roles \\nand responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by \\ncompetent personnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to \\nenvisage additional safeguards to ensure that the predictions, recommendations or \\ndecisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and disregarded and that personal \\ndata is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to \\nparticipate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the EU data \\nprotection law. As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data \\ncollected and processed for the purpose of the testing in real world conditions should only \\nbe transferred to third countries outside the Union provided appropriate and applicable \\nsafeguards under Union law are implemented, notably in accordance with bases for \\ntransfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non-personal data \\nappropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as the Data \\nGovernance Act and the Data Act. \\n(72c)  To ensure that Artificial Intelligence leads to socially and environmentally beneficial \\noutcomes, Member States are encouraged to support and promote research and \\ndevelopment of AI solutions  in support of socially and environmentally beneficial \\noutcomes, such as AI-based solutions to increase accessibility for persons with disabilities, \\ntackle socio-economic inequalities, or meet environmental targets, by allocating sufficient \\nresources, including public and Union funding, and, where appropriate and provided that \\nthe eligibility and selection criteria are fulfilled, considering in particular projects which \\npursue such objectives. Such projects should be based on the principle of interdisciplinary \\ncooperation between AI developers, experts on inequality and non- discrimination, \\naccessibility, consumer, environmental, and digital rights, as well as academics. \\n(73) \\nIn order to promote and protect innovation, it is important that the interests of SMEs, \\nincluding start-ups, that are providers or   deployers of AI systems are taken into particular \\naccount. To this objective, Member States should develop initiatives, which are targeted at \\nthose operators, including on, awareness raising and information communication. Member \\nStates shall provide SME’s, including start-ups, having a registered office or a branch in \\nthe Union, with priority access to the AI regulatory sandboxes provided that they fulfil the \\neligibility conditions and selection criteria and without precluding other providers and \\nprospective providers to access the sandboxes provided the same conditions and criteria are \\nfulfilled. Member States shall utilise existing channels and where appropriate, establish \\nnew dedicated channels for communication with SMEs, start-ups, deployers other \\ninnovators and, as appropriate, local public authorities, to support SMEs throughout their \\ndevelopment path by providing guidance and responding to queries about the \\nimplementation of this Regulation. Where appropriate, these channels shall work together \\nto create synergies and ensure homogeneity in their guidance to SMEs including start-ups \\nand deployers. Additionally, Member States should facilitate the participation of SMEs and \\nother relevant stakeholders in the standardisation development processes. Moreover, the \\nspecific interests and needs of SMEs including start-up providers should be taken into \\naccount when Notified Bodies set conformity assessment fees. The Commission should \\nregularly assess the certification and compliance costs for SMEs including start-ups, \\nthrough transparent consultations deployers and should work with Member States to lower \\nsuch costs. For example, translation costs related to mandatory documentation and \\ncommunication with authorities may constitute a significant cost for providers and other \\noperators, notably those of a smaller scale. Member States should possibly ensure that one \\nof the languages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation \\nand for communication with operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest \\npossible number of cross-border deployers. In order to address the specific needs of SMEs \\nincluding start-ups, the Commission should provide standardised templates for the areas \\ncovered by this Regulation upon request of the AI Board. Additionally, the Commission \\nshould complement Member States’ efforts by providing a single information platform \\nwith easy-to-use information with regards to this Regulation for all providers and \\ndeployers, by organising appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about \\nthe obligations arising from this Regulation, and by evaluating and promoting the \\nconvergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems.  \\nMedium-sized enterprises which recently changed from the small to medium-size category \\nwithin the meaning of the Annex to Recommendation 2003/361/EC (Article 16) should \\nhave access to these support measures, as these new medium-sized enterprises may \\nsometimes lack the legal resources and training necessary to ensure proper understanding \\nand compliance with provisions. \\n(73a) \\nIn order to promote and protect innovation, the AI-on demand platform, all relevant EU \\nfunding programmes and projects, such as Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe, \\nimplemented by the Commission and the Member States at national or Union level should, \\nas appropriate, contribute to the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation. \\n(74) \\nIn particular, in order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of \\nknowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers, \\nnotably SMEs, including start-ups, and notified bodies with their obligations under this \\nRegulation, the AI-on demand platform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and the \\nTesting and Experimentation Facilities established by the Commission and the Member \\nStates at national or EU level should  contribute to the implementation of this Regulation. \\nWithin their respective mission and fields of competence, they may provide in particular \\ntechnical and scientific support to providers and notified bodies. \\n(74a)  Moreover, in order to ensure proportionality considering the very small size of some \\noperators regarding costs of innovation, it is appropriate to allow microenterprises to fulfil \\none of the most costly obligations, namely to establish a quality management system, in a \\nsimplified manner which would reduce the administrative burden and the costs for those \\nenterprises without affecting the level of protection and the need for compliance with the \\nrequirements for high-risk AI systems. The Commission should develop guidelines to \\nspecify the elements of the quality management system to be fulfilled in this simplified \\nmanner by microenterprises. \\n(75) \\nIt is appropriate that the Commission facilitates, to the extent possible, access to Testing \\nand Experimentation Facilities to bodies, groups or laboratories established or accredited \\npursuant to any relevant Union harmonisation legislation and which fulfil tasks in the \\ncontext of conformity assessment of products or devices covered by that Union \\nharmonisation legislation. This is notably the case for expert panels, expert laboratories \\nand reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to Regulation (EU) \\n2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746. \\n(75a)  This Regulation should establish a governance framework that both allows to coordinate \\nand support the application of this Regulation at national level, as well as build capabilities \\nat Union level and integrate stakeholders in the field of artificial intelligence. The effective \\nimplementation and enforcement of this Regulation require a governance framework that \\nallows to coordinate and build up central expertise at Union level. The Commission has \\nestablished the AI Office by Commission decision of […], which has as its mission to \\ndevelop Union expertise and capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence and to \\ncontribute to the implementation of Union legislation on artificial intelligence. Member \\nStates should facilitate the tasks of the AI Office with a view to support the development of \\nUnion expertise and capabilities at Union level and to strengthen the functioning of the \\ndigital single market. Furthermore, a European Artificial Intelligence Board composed of \\nrepresentatives of the Member States, a scientific panel to integrate the scientific \\ncommunity and an advisory forum to contribute stakeholder input to the implementation of \\nthis Regulation, both at national and Union level, should be established. The development \\nof Union expertise and capabilities should also include making use of existing resources \\nand expertise, notably through synergies with structures built up in the context of the \\nUnion level enforcement of other legislation and synergies with related initiatives at Union \\nlevel, such as the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and the AI Testing and Experimentation \\nFacilities under the Digital Europe Programme. \\n(76) \\nIn order to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this Regulation \\na European Artificial Intelligence Board should be established. The Board should reflect \\nthe various interests of the AI eco-system and be composed of representatives of the \\nMember States. The Board should be responsible for a number of advisory tasks, including \\nissuing opinions, recommendations, advice or contributing to guidance on matters related \\nto the implementation of this Regulation, including on enforcement matters, technical \\nspecifications or existing standards regarding the requirements established in this \\nRegulation and providing advice to the Commission and the Member States and their \\nnational competent authorities on specific questions related to artificial intelligence. In \\norder to give some flexibility to Member States in the designation of their representatives \\nin the AI Board, such representatives may be any persons belonging to public entities who \\nshould have the relevant competences and powers to facilitate coordination at national \\nlevel and contribute to the achievement of the Board\\'s tasks. The Board should establish \\ntwo standing sub-groups to provide a platform for cooperation and exchange among \\nmarket surveillance authorities and notifying authorities on issues related respectively to \\nmarket surveillance and notified bodies. The standing subgroup for market surveillance \\nshould act as the Administrative Cooperation Group (ADCO) for this Regulation in the \\nmeaning of Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. In line with the role and tasks of the \\nCommission pursuant to Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, the Commission should \\nsupport the activities of the standing subgroup for market surveillance by undertaking \\nmarket evaluations or studies, notably with a view to identifying aspects of this Regulation \\nrequiring specific and urgent coordination among market surveillance authorities. The \\nBoard may establish other standing or temporary sub-groups as appropriate for the purpose \\nof examining specific issues. The Board should also cooperate, as appropriate, with \\nrelevant EU bodies, expert groups and networks active in the context of relevant EU \\nlegislation, including in particular those active under relevant EU regulation on data, \\ndigital products and services. \\n(76x)   With a view to ensure the involvement of stakeholders in the implementation and \\napplication of this Regulation, an advisory forum should be established to advise and \\nprovide technical expertise to the Board and the Commission. To ensure a varied and \\nbalanced stakeholder representation between commercial and non-commercial interest and, \\nwithin the category of commercial interests, with regards to SMEs and other undertakings, \\nthe advisory forum should comprise inter alia industry, start-ups, SMEs, academia, civil \\nsociety, including social partners, as well as the Fundamental Rights Agency, European \\nUnion Agency for Cybersecurity, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the \\nEuropean Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the European \\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). \\n(76y)   To support the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, in particular the \\nmonitoring activities of the AI Office as regards general-purpose AI models, a scientific \\npanel of independent experts should be established. The independent experts constituting \\nthe scientific panel should be selected on the basis of up-to-date scientific or technical \\nexpertise in the field of artificial intelligence and should perform their tasks with \\nimpartiality, objectivity and ensure the confidentiality of information and data obtained in \\ncarrying out their tasks and activities. To allow reinforcing national capacities necessary \\nfor the effective enforcement of this Regulation, Member States should be able to request \\nsupport from the pool of experts constituting the scientific panel for their enforcement \\nactivities. \\n(76a) \\nIn order to support adequate enforcement as regards AI systems and reinforce the \\ncapacities of the Member States, EU AI testing support structures should be established \\nand made available to the Member States. \\n(77)  Member States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this Regulation. In \\nthis respect, each Member State should designate at least one notifying authority and at \\nleast one market surveillance authority as national competent authorities for the purpose of \\nsupervising the application and implementation of this Regulation. Member States may \\ndecide to appoint any kind of public entity to perform the tasks of the national competent \\nauthorities within the meaning of this Regulation, in accordance with their specific national \\norganisational characteristics and needs. In order to increase organisation efficiency on the \\nside of Member States and to set a single point of contact vis-à-vis the public and other \\ncounterparts at Member State and Union levels, each Member State should designate a \\nmarket surveillance authority to act as single point of contact. \\n(77a)  The national competent authorities should exercise their powers independently, impartially \\nand without bias, so as to safeguard the principles of objectivity of their activities and tasks \\nand to ensure the application and implementation of this Regulation. The members of these \\nauthorities should refrain from any action incompatible with their duties and should be \\nsubject to confidentiality rules under this Regulation.  \\n(78) \\nIn order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into account the \\nexperience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their systems and the design \\nand development process or can take any possible corrective action in a timely manner, all \\nproviders should have a post-market monitoring system in place. Where relevant, post-\\nmarket monitoring should include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems \\nincluding other devices and software. Post-market monitoring should not cover sensitive \\noperational data of deployers which are law enforcement authorities. This system is also \\nkey to ensure that the possible risks emerging from AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ \\nafter being placed on the market or put into service can be more efficiently and timely \\naddressed. In this context, providers should also be required to have a system in place to \\nreport to the relevant authorities any serious incidents resulting from the use of their AI \\nsystems, meaning incident or malfunctioning leading to death or serious damage to health, \\nserious and irreversible disruption of the management and operation of critical \\ninfrastructure, breaches of obligations under Union law intended to protect fundamental \\nrights or serious damage to property or the environment.  \\n(79) \\nIn order to ensure an appropriate and effective enforcement of the requirements and \\nobligations set out by this Regulation, which is Union harmonisation legislation, the \\nsystem of market surveillance and compliance of products established by Regulation (EU) \\n2019/1020 should apply in its entirety. Market surveillance authorities designated pursuant \\nto this Regulation should have all enforcement powers under this Regulation and \\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 and should exercise their powers and carry out their duties \\nindependently, impartially and without bias. Although the majority of AI systems are not \\nsubject to specific requirements and obligations under this Regulation, market surveillance \\nauthorities may take measures in relation to all AI systems when they present a risk in \\naccordance with this Regulation. Due to the specific nature of Union institutions, agencies \\nand bodies falling within the scope of this Regulation, it is appropriate to designate the \\nEuropean Data Protection Supervisor as a competent market surveillance authority for \\nthem. This should be without prejudice to the designation of national competent authorities \\nby the Member States. Market surveillance activities should not affect the ability of the \\nsupervised entities to carry out their tasks independently, when such independence is \\nrequired by Union law. \\n(79a)  This Regulation is without prejudice to the competences, tasks, powers and independence \\nof relevant national public authorities or bodies which supervise the application of Union \\nlaw protecting fundamental rights, including equality bodies and data protection \\nauthorities. Where necessary for their mandate, those national public authorities or bodies \\nshould also have access to any documentation created under this Regulation. A specific \\nsafeguard procedure should be set for ensuring adequate and timely enforcement against \\nAI systems presenting a risk to health, safety and fundamental rights. The procedure for \\nsuch AI systems presenting a risk should be applied to high-risk AI systems presenting a \\nrisk, prohibited systems which have been placed on the market, put into service or used in \\nviolation of the prohibited practices laid down in this Regulation and AI systems which \\nhave been made available in violation of the transparency requirements laid down in this \\nRegulation and present a risk. \\n(80) \\nUnion legislation on financial services includes internal governance and risk management \\nrules and requirements which are applicable to regulated financial institutions in the course \\nof provision of those services, including when they make use of AI systems. In order to \\nensure coherent application and enforcement of the obligations under this Regulation and \\nrelevant rules and requirements of the Union financial services legislation, the competent \\nauthorities for the supervision and enforcement of the financial services legislation, notably \\ncompetent authorities as defined in Directive 2009/138/EC, Directive (EU) 2016/97, \\nDirective 2013/36/EU Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Directive 2008/48/EC and Directive \\n2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, should be designated, within \\ntheir respective competences, as competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the \\nimplementation of this Regulation, including for market surveillance activities, as regards \\nAI systems provided or used by regulated and supervised financial institutions unless \\nMember States decide to designate another authority to fulfil these market surveillance \\ntasks. Those competent authorities should have all powers under this Regulation and \\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance to enforce the requirements and \\nobligations of this Regulation, including powers to carry our ex post market surveillance \\nactivities that can be integrated, as appropriate, into their existing supervisory mechanisms \\nand procedures under the relevant Union financial services legislation. It is appropriate to \\nenvisage that, when acting as market surveillance authorities under this Regulation, the \\nnational authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions regulated under \\nDirective 2013/36/EU, which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism \\n(SSM) established by Council Regulation No 1024/2013, should report, without delay, to \\nthe European Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market \\nsurveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the European Central Bank’s \\nprudential supervisory tasks as specified in that Regulation. To further enhance the \\nconsistency between this Regulation and the rules applicable to credit institutions regulated \\nunder Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council27, it is also \\nappropriate to integrate some of the providers’ procedural obligations in relation to risk \\nmanagement, post marketing monitoring and documentation into the existing obligations \\nand procedures under Directive 2013/36/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited \\nderogations should also be envisaged in relation to the quality management system of \\nproviders and the monitoring obligation placed on deployers of high-risk AI systems to the \\nextent that these apply to credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU. The same \\nregime should apply to insurance and re-insurance undertakings and insurance holding \\ncompanies under Directive 2009/138/EU (Solvency II) and the insurance intermediaries \\nunder Directive 2016/97/EU and other types of financial institutions subject to \\nrequirements regarding internal governance, arrangements or processes established \\npursuant to the relevant Union financial services legislation to ensure consistency and \\nequal treatment in the financial sector. \\n                                                 \\n(80-x)   Each  market surveillance authority for high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III \\ninsofar as these systems are used for law enforcement purposes and for purposes listed in \\npoints 6, 7 and 8 of Annex III  should have effective investigative and corrective powers, \\nincluding at least the power to obtain access to all personal data that are being processed \\nand to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks. The market surveillance \\nauthorities should be able to exercise their powers by acting with complete independence. \\nAny limitations of their access to sensitive operational data under this Regulation should \\nbe without prejudice to the powers conferred to them by Directive 2016/680. No exclusion \\non disclosing data to national data protection authorities under this Regulation should \\naffect the current or future powers of those authorities beyond the scope of this Regulation. \\n(80x)   The  market surveillance  authorities of the Member States and the Commission should be \\nable to propose joint activities, including joint investigations, to be conducted by market \\nsurveillance authorities or market surveillance authorities jointly with the Commission, \\nthat have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness \\nand providing guidance in relation to this Regulation with respect to specific categories of \\nhigh-risk AI systems that are found to present a serious risk across several Member States. \\nJoint activities to promote compliance should be carried out in accordance with Article 9 of \\nthe 2019/1020. The AI Office should provide coordination support for joint investigations.  \\n(80y)  \\nIt is necessary to clarify the responsibilities and competences on national and Union level \\nas regards AI systems that are built on general-purpose AI models. To avoid overlapping \\ncompetences, where an AI system is based on a general-purpose AI model and the model \\nand system are provided by the same provider, the supervision should take place at Union \\nlevel through the AI Office, which should have the powers of a market surveillance \\nauthority within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 for this purpose. In all other \\ncases, national market surveillance authorities remain responsible for the supervision of AI \\nsystems. However, for general-purpose AI systems that can be used directly by deployers \\nfor at least one purpose that is classified as high-risk, market surveillance authorities \\nshould cooperate with the AI Office to carry out evaluations of compliance and inform the \\nBoard and other market surveillance authorities accordingly. Furthermore, market \\nsurveillance authorities should be able to request assistance from the AI Office where the \\nmarket surveillance authority is unable to conclude an investigation on a high-risk AI \\nsystem because of its inability to access certain information related to the general-purpose \\nAI model on which the high-risk AI system is built. In such cases, the procedure regarding \\nmutual assistance in cross-border cases in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 \\nshould apply by analogy. \\n(80z)   To make best use of the centralised Union expertise and synergies at Union level, the \\npowers of supervision and enforcement of the obligations on providers of general-purpose \\nAI models should be a competence of the Commission. The Commission should entrust the \\nimplementation of these tasks to the AI Office, without prejudice to the powers of \\norganisation of the Commission and the division of competences between member States \\nand the Union based on the Treaties. The AI Office should be able to carry out all \\nnecessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of this Regulation as regards \\ngeneral-purpose AI models. It should be able to investigate possible infringements of the \\nrules on providers of general-purpose AI models both on its own initiative, following the \\nresults of its monitoring activities, or upon request from market surveillance authorities in \\nline with the conditions set out in this Regulation. To support effective monitoring of the \\nAI Office, it should provide for the possibility that downstream providers lodge complaints \\nabout possible infringements of the rules on providers of general purpose AI models. \\n(80z+1) With a view to complement the governance systems for general-purpose AI models, the \\nscientific panel should support the monitoring activities of the AI Office and may, in \\ncertain cases, provide qualified alerts to the AI Office which trigger follow-ups such as \\ninvestigations. This should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that \\na general-purpose AI model poses a concrete and identifiable risk at Union level. \\nFurthermore, this should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a \\ngeneral-purpose AI model meets the criteria that would lead to a classification as general-\\npurpose AI model with systemic risk. To equip the scientific panel with the information \\nnecessary for the performance of these tasks, there should be a mechanism whereby the \\nscientific panel can request the Commission to require documentation or information from \\na provider.  \\n(80z+2)  The AI Office should be able to take the necessary actions to monitor the effective \\nimplementation of and compliance with the obligations for providers of general purpose AI \\nmodels laid down in this Regulation. The AI Office should be able to investigate possible \\ninfringements in accordance with the powers provided for in this Regulation, including by \\nrequesting documentation and information, by conducting evaluations, as well as by \\nrequesting measures from providers of general purpose AI models. In the conduct of \\nevaluations, in order to make use of independent expertise, the AI Office should be able to \\ninvolve independent experts to carry out the evaluations on its behalf. Compliance with the \\nobligations should be enforceable, inter alia, through requests to take appropriate measures, \\nincluding risk mitigation measures in case of identified systemic risks as well as restricting \\nthe making available on the market, withdrawing or recalling the model. As a safeguard in \\ncase needed beyond the procedural rights provided for in this Regulation, providers of \\ngeneral-purpose AI models should have the procedural rights provided for in Article 18 of \\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020, which should apply by analogy, without prejudice to more \\nspecific procedural rights provided for by this Regulation.  \\n(81) \\nThe development of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems in accordance with the \\nrequirements of this Regulation may lead to a larger uptake of ethical and trustworthy \\nartificial intelligence in the Union. Providers of non-high-risk AI systems should be \\nencouraged to create codes of conduct, including related governance mechanisms, intended \\nto foster the voluntary application of some or all of the mandatory requirements applicable \\nto high-risk AI systems, adapted in light of the intended purpose of the systems and the \\nlower risk involved and taking into account the available technical solutions and industry \\nbest practices such as model and data cards. Providers and, as appropriate, deployers of all  \\nAI systems, high-risk or not, and models should also be encouraged to apply on a \\nvoluntary basis additional requirements related, for example, to the elements of the \\nEuropean ethic guidelines for trustworthy AI, environmental sustainability, AI literacy \\nmeasures, inclusive and diverse design and development of AI systems, including attention \\nto vulnerable persons and accessibility to persons with disability, stakeholders’ \\nparticipation with the involvement as appropriate, of relevant stakeholders such as business \\nand civil society organisations, academia and research organisations, trade unions and \\nconsumer protection organisation in the design and development of AI systems, and \\ndiversity of the development teams, including gender balance. To ensure that the voluntary \\ncodes of conduct are effective, they should be based on clear objectives and key \\nperformance indicators to measure the achievement of those objectives. They should be \\nalso developed in an inclusive way, as appropriate, with the involvement of relevant \\nstakeholders such as business and civil society organisations, academia and research \\norganisations, trade unions and consumer protection organisation. The Commission may \\ndevelop initiatives, including of a sectorial nature, to facilitate the lowering of technical \\nbarriers hindering cross-border exchange of data for AI development, including on data \\naccess infrastructure, semantic and technical interoperability of different types of data. \\n(82) \\nIt is important that AI systems related to products that are not high-risk in accordance with \\nthis Regulation and thus are not required to comply with the requirements set out for high-\\nrisk AI systems are nevertheless safe when placed on the market or put into service. To \\ncontribute to this objective, Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of \\nthe Council28 would apply as a safety net. \\n(83) \\nIn order to ensure trustful and constructive cooperation of competent authorities on Union \\nand national level, all parties involved in the application of this Regulation should respect \\nthe confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks, in \\naccordance with Union or national law. They should carry out their tasks and activities in \\nsuch a manner as to protect, in particular, intellectual property rights, confidential business \\ninformation and trade secrets, the effective implementation of this Regulation, public and \\nnational security interests, the integrity of criminal or administrative proceedings, and the \\nintegrity of classified information. \\n(84) \\nCompliance with this Regulation should be enforceable by means of the imposition of \\npenalties and other enforcement measures. Member States should take all necessary \\nmeasures to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by \\nlaying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement, and in \\nrespect of the ne bis in idem principle. In order to strengthen and harmonise administrative \\npenalties for infringement of this Regulation, the upper limits for setting the administrative \\nfines for certain specific infringements should be laid down. When assessing the amount of \\nthe fines, Member States should, in each individual case, take into account all relevant \\ncircumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity \\nand duration of the infringement and of its consequences and to the provider’s size, in \\nparticular if the provider is an SME including a start-up. The European Data Protection \\nSupervisor should have the power to impose fines on Union institutions, agencies and \\nbodies falling within the scope of this Regulation. \\n(84a)   Compliance with the obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models imposed \\nunder this Regulation should be enforceable among others by means of fines. To that end, \\nappropriate levels of fines should also be laid down for infringement of those obligations, \\n                                                 \\nincluding the failure to comply with measures requested by the Commission in accordance \\nwith this Regulation, subject to appropriate limitation periods in accordance with the \\nprinciple of proportionality. All decisions taken by the Commission under this Regulation \\nare subject to review by the Court of Justice of the European Union in accordance with the \\nTFEU. \\n(84aa)  Union and national law already provides effective remedies to natural and legal persons \\nwhose rights and freedoms are adversely affected by the use of AI systems. Without \\nprejudice to those remedies, any natural or legal person having grounds to consider that \\nthere has been an infringement of the provisions of this Regulation should be entitled to \\nlodge a complaint to the relevant market surveillance authority or the AI Office where \\napplicable. \\n(84b)  Affected persons should have the right to request an explanation when a decision is taken \\nby the deployer with the output from certain high-risk systems as provided for in this \\nRegulation as the main basis and which produces legal effects or similarly significantly \\naffects him or her in a way that they consider to adversely impact their health, safety or \\nfundamental rights. This explanation should be a clear and meaningful and should provide \\na basis for affected persons to exercise their rights. This should not apply to the use of AI \\nsystems for which exceptions or restrictions follow from Union or national law and should \\napply only to the extent this right is not already provided for under Union legislation. \\n(84c) \\nPersons acting as ‘whistle-blowers’ on the breaches of this Regulation should be afforded \\nthe protection guaranteed by Union legislation on the protection of persons who report \\nbreaches of law. Therefore, Directive (EU) 2019/1937 should apply to the reporting of \\nbreaches of this Regulation and the protection of persons reporting such breaches. \\n(85) \\nIn order to ensure that the regulatory framework can be adapted where necessary, the \\npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the \\nCommission to amend the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, the high-risk \\nAI systems listed in Annex III, the provisions regarding technical documentation listed in \\nAnnex IV, the content of the EU declaration of conformity in Annex V, the provisions \\nregarding the conformity assessment procedures in Annex VI and VII, the provisions \\nestablishing the high-risk AI systems to which the conformity assessment procedure based \\non assessment of the quality management system and assessment of the technical \\ndocumentation should apply, the threshold as well as to supplement benchmarks and \\nindicators in the rules for classification of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, \\nthe criteria for the designation of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk in Annex \\nIXc, the technical documentation for providers of general-purpose AI models in Annex \\nVIIIb and the transparency information for providers of general-purpose AI models in \\nAnnex VIIIc. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate \\nconsultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those \\nconsultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the \\nInterinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making1. In particular, to \\nensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament \\nand the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and \\ntheir experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing \\nwith the preparation of delegated acts. \\n(85a)  Given the rapid technological developments and the required technical expertise in the \\neffective application of this Regulation, the Commission should evaluate and review this \\nRegulation by three years after the date of entry into application and every four years \\nthereafter and report to the European Parliament and the Council. In addition, taking into \\naccount the implications for the scope of this Regulation, the Commission should carry out \\nan assessment of the need to amend the list in Annex III and the list of prohibited practices \\nonce a year. Moreover, by two years after entry into application and every four years \\nthereafter, the Commission should evaluate and report to the European Parliament and to \\nthe Council on the need to amend the high-risk areas in Annex III, the AI systems within \\nthe scope of the transparency obligations in Title IV, the effectiveness of the supervision \\nand governance system and the progress on the development of standardisation \\ndeliverables on energy efficient development of general-purpose AI models, including the \\nneed for further measures or actions. Finally, within two years after the entry into \\napplication and every three years thereafter, the Commission should evaluate the impact \\nand effectiveness of voluntary codes of conducts to foster the application of the \\nrequirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2, for systems other than high-risk AI systems and \\npossibly other additional requirements for such AI systems. \\n(86) \\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, \\nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be \\nexercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament \\nand of the Council1. \\n(87) \\nSince the objective of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member \\nStates and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at \\nUnion level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of \\nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality \\nas set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to \\nachieve that objective. \\n(87a) \\nIn order to ensure legal certainty, ensure an appropriate adaptation period for operators and \\navoid disruption to the market, including by ensuring continuity of the use of AI systems, it \\nis appropriate that this Regulation applies to the high-risk AI systems that have been placed \\non the market or put into service before the general date of application thereof, only if, \\nfrom that date, those systems are subject to significant changes in their design or intended \\npurpose. It is appropriate to clarify that, in this respect, the concept of significant change \\nshould be understood as equivalent in substance to the notion of substantial modification, \\nwhich is used with regard only to high-risk AI systems as defined in this Regulation. By \\nway of exception and in light of public accountability, operators of AI systems which are \\ncomponents of the large-scale IT systems established by the legal acts listed in Annex IX \\nand operators of high-risk AI systems that are intended to be used by public authorities \\nshould take the necessary steps to comply with the requirements of this Regulation by end \\nof 2030 and by four years after the entry into application respectively. \\n(87b) \\nProviders of high-risk AI systems are encouraged to start to comply, on voluntary basis, \\nwith the relevant obligations foreseen under this Regulation already during the transitional \\nperiod. \\n(88) \\nThis Regulation should apply from … [OP – please insert the date established in Art. 85]. \\nHowever, taking into account the unacceptable risk associated with the use of AI in certain \\nways, the prohibitions should apply already from … [OP – please insert the date – 6 \\nmonths after entry into force of this Regulation]. While the full effect of these prohibitions \\nfollows with the establishment of the governance and enforcement of this Regulation, \\nanticipating the application of the prohibitions is important to take account of unacceptable \\nrisk and has effect on other procedures, such as in civil law. Moreover, the infrastructure \\nrelated to the governance and the conformity assessment system should be operational \\nbefore [OP – please insert the date established in Art. 85], therefore the provisions on \\nnotified bodies and governance structure should apply from … [OP – please insert the date \\n– twelve months following the entry into force of this Regulation]. Given the rapid pace of \\ntechnological advancements and adoption of general-purpose AI models, obligations for \\nproviders of general purpose AI models should apply within 12 months from the date of \\nentry into force. Codes of Practice should be ready at the latest 3 months before the entry \\ninto application of the relevant provisions, to enable providers to demonstrate compliance \\nin time. The AI Office should ensure that classification rules and procedures are up to date \\nin light of technological developments.

In deciding on the request, the competent judicial \\nauthority or an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding shall take \\ninto account the elements referred to in paragraph 2.  It shall be ensured that no decision \\nthat produces an adverse legal effect on a person may be taken by the judicial authority or \\nan independent administrative authority whose decision is binding solely based on the \\noutput of the remote biometric identification system.  \\n3a. \\nWithout prejudice to paragraph 3, each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification \\nsystem in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes shall be notified to the \\nrelevant market surveillance authority and the national data protection authority in \\naccordance with the national rules referred to in paragraph 4. The notification shall as a \\nminimum contain the information specified under paragraph 5 and shall not include \\nsensitive operational data.  \\n4. \\nA Member State may decide to provide for the possibility to fully or partially authorise the \\nuse of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for \\nthe purpose of law enforcement within the limits and under the conditions listed in \\nparagraphs 1, point (d), 2 and 3. Member States concerned shall lay down in their national \\nlaw the necessary detailed rules for the request, issuance and exercise of, as well as \\nsupervision and reporting relating to, the authorisations referred to in paragraph 3. Those \\nrules shall also specify in respect of which of the objectives listed in paragraph 1, point (d), \\nincluding which of the criminal offences referred to in point (iii) thereof, the competent \\nauthorities may be authorised to use those systems for the purpose of law enforcement. \\nMember States shall notify those rules to the Commission at the latest 30 days following \\nthe adoption thereof.  Member States may introduce, in accordance with Union law, more \\nrestrictive laws on the use of remote biometric identification systems.  \\n5. \\nNational market surveillance authorities and the national data protection authorities of \\nMember States that have been notified of the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric \\nidentification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes pursuant \\nto paragraph 3a shall submit to the Commission annual reports on such use. For that \\npurpose, the Commission shall provide Member States and national market surveillance \\nand data protection authorities with a template, including information on the number of the \\ndecisions taken by competent judicial authorities or an independent administrative \\nauthority whose decision is binding upon requests for authorisations in accordance with \\nparagraph 3 and their result. \\n6. \\nThe Commission shall publish annual reports on the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric \\nidentification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes based on \\naggregated data in Member States based on the annual reports referred to in paragraph 5, \\nwhich shall not include sensitive operational data of the related law enforcement activities. \\nTITLE III \\nHIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS \\nChapter 1 \\nCLASSIFICATION OF AI SYSTEMS AS HIGH-RISK \\nArticle 6 \\nClassification rules for high-risk AI systems \\n1. \\nIrrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service \\nindependently from the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be \\nconsidered high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled: \\n(a) \\nthe AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI \\nsystem is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in \\nAnnex II; \\n(b) \\nthe product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the AI \\nsystem itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity \\nassessment, with a view to the placing on the market or putting into service of that \\nproduct pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II. \\n2. \\nIn addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in \\nAnnex III shall also be considered high-risk. \\n2a. \\nBy derogation from paragraph 2 AI systems shall not be considered as high risk if they do \\nnot pose a significant risk of harm, to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural \\npersons, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making. This \\nshall be the case if one or more of the following criteria are fulfilled: \\n(a) \\nthe AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task; \\n(b) \\nthe AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human \\nactivity;  \\n(c) \\nthe AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior \\ndecision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously \\ncompleted human assessment, without proper human review; or \\n(d) \\nthe AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for \\nthe purpose of the use cases listed in Annex III. \\nNotwithstanding first subparagraph of this paragraph, an AI system shall always be \\nconsidered high-risk if the AI system performs profiling of natural persons. \\n2b. \\nA provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk shall \\ndocument its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service. \\nSuch provider shall be subject to the registration obligation set out in Article 51(1a). Upon \\nrequest of national competent authorities, the provider shall provide the documentation of \\nthe assessment. \\n2c. \\nThe Commission shall, after consulting the AI Board, and no later than 18 months after the \\nentry into force of this Regulation, provide guidelines specifying the practical \\nimplementation of this article completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of \\nhigh risk and non-high risk use cases on AI systems in accordance with the conditions set \\nout in Article 82a. \\n2d. \\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to \\namend the criteria laid down in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a.  \\nThe Commission may adopt delegated acts adding new criteria to those laid down in points \\n(a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a, or modifying them, only where there is \\nconcrete and reliable evidence of the existence of AI systems that fall under the scope of \\nAnnex III but that do not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety and \\nfundamental rights. \\nThe Commission shall adopt delegated acts deleting any of the criteria laid down in the \\nfirst subparagraph of paragraph 2a where there is concrete and reliable evidence that this is \\nnecessary for the purpose of maintaining the level of protection of health, safety and \\nfundamental rights in the Union. \\nAny amendment to the criteria laid down in points (a) to (d) set out in the first \\nsubparagraph of paragraph 2a shall not decrease the overall level of protection of health, \\nsafety and fundamental rights in the Union. \\nWhen adopting the delegated acts, the Commission shall ensure consistency with the \\ndelegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(1) and shall take account of market and \\ntechnological developments. \\nArticle 7 \\nAmendments to Annex III \\n1. \\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to \\namend Annex III by adding or modifying use cases of high-risk AI systems where both of \\nthe following conditions are fulfilled: \\n(a) \\nthe AI systems are intended to be used in any of the areas listed in points 1 to 8 of \\nAnnex III; \\n(b) \\nthe AI systems pose a risk of harm to health and safety, or an adverse impact on \\nfundamental rights, and that risk is equivalent to or greater than the risk of harm or of \\nadverse impact posed by the high-risk AI systems already referred to in Annex III.  \\n2. \\nWhen assessing for the purposes of paragraph 1 whether an AI system poses a risk of harm \\nto the health and safety or a risk of adverse impact on fundamental rights that is equivalent \\nto or greater than the risk of harm posed by the high-risk AI systems already referred to in \\nAnnex III, the Commission shall take into account the following criteria: \\n(a) \\nthe intended purpose of the AI system; \\n(b) \\nthe extent to which an AI system has been used or is likely to be used; \\n(ba)  the nature and amount of the data processed and used by the AI system, in particular \\nwhether special categories of personal data are processed; \\n(bb)  the extent to which the AI system acts autonomously and the possibility for a human \\nto override a decision or recommendations that may lead to potential harm; \\n(c) \\nthe extent to which the use of an AI system has already caused harm to health and \\nsafety, has had an adverse impact on fundamental rights or has given rise to \\nsignificant concerns in relation to the likelihood of such harm or adverse impact, as \\ndemonstrated for example by reports or documented allegations submitted to national \\ncompetent authorities or by other reports, as appropriate;  \\n(d) \\nthe potential extent of such harm or such adverse impact, in particular in terms of its \\nintensity and its ability to affect a plurality of persons or to disproportionately affect \\na particular group of persons; \\n(e) \\nthe extent to which potentially harmed or adversely impacted persons are dependent \\non the outcome produced with an AI system, in particular because for practical or \\nlegal reasons it is not reasonably possible to opt-out from that outcome; \\n(f) \\nthe extent to which there is an imbalance of power, or the potentially harmed or \\nadversely impacted persons are in a vulnerable position in relation to the user of an \\nAI system, in particular due to status, authority, knowledge, economic or social \\ncircumstances, or age; \\n(g) \\nthe extent to which the outcome produced involving an AI system is easily corrigible \\nor reversible, taking into account the technical solutions available to correct or \\nreverse, whereby outcomes having and adverse impact on health, safety, fundamental \\nrights, shall not be considered as easily corrigible or reversible; \\n(gb)  the magnitude and likelihood of benefit of the deployment of the AI system for \\nindividuals, groups, or society at large, including possible improvements in product \\nsafety; \\n(h) \\nthe extent to which existing Union legislation provides for: \\n(i) \\neffective measures of redress in relation to the risks posed by an AI system, \\nwith the exclusion of claims for damages; \\n(ii) \\neffective measures to prevent or substantially minimise those risks. \\n2a. \\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to \\namend the list in Annex III by removing high-risk AI systems where both of the following \\nconditions are fulfilled: \\n(a) \\nthe high-risk AI system(s) concerned no longer pose any significant risks to \\nfundamental rights, health or safety, taking into account the criteria listed in \\nparagraph 2; \\n(b) \\nthe deletion does not decrease the overall level of protection of health, safety and \\nfundamental rights under Union law. \\nChapter 2 \\nREQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS \\nArticle 8 \\nCompliance with the requirements \\n1. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall comply with the requirements established in this Chapter, \\ntaking into account its intended purpose as well as the generally acknowledged state of the \\nart on AI and AI related technologies. The risk management system referred to in Article 9 \\nshall be taken into account when ensuring compliance with those requirements. \\n2a. \\nWhere a product contains an artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of \\nthis Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in \\nAnnex II, Section A apply, providers shall be responsible for ensuring that their product is \\nfully compliant with all applicable requirements required under the Union harmonisation \\nlegislation. In ensuring the compliance of high-risk AI systems referred in paragraph 1 \\nwith the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, and in order to ensure consistency, \\navoid duplications and minimise additional burdens, providers shall have a choice to \\nintegrate, as appropriate, the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and \\ndocumentation they provide with regard to their product into already existing \\ndocumentation and procedures required under the Union harmonisation legislation listed in \\nAnnex II, Section A. \\nArticle 9 \\nRisk management system \\n1. \\nA risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained \\nin relation to high-risk AI systems. \\n2. \\nThe risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process planned \\nand run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular \\nsystematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps: \\n(a) \\nidentification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the \\nhigh-risk AI system can pose to the health, safety or fundamental rights when the \\nhigh-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose; \\n(b) \\nestimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system \\nis used in accordance with its intended purpose and under conditions of reasonably \\nforeseeable misuse; \\n(c) \\nevaluation of other possibly arising risks based on the analysis of data gathered from \\nthe post-market monitoring system referred to in Article 61; \\n(d) \\nadoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address \\nthe risks identified pursuant to point a of this paragraph in accordance with the \\nprovisions of the following paragraphs. \\n2a. \\nThe risks referred to in this paragraph shall concern only those which may be reasonably \\nmitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or \\nthe provision of adequate technical information.  \\n3. \\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall give due \\nconsideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined \\napplication of the requirements set out in this Chapter 2, with a view to minimising risks \\nmore effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures to \\nfulfil those requirements. \\n4. \\nThe risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall be such that \\nrelevant residual risk associated with each hazard as well as the overall residual risk of the \\nhigh-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable. \\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be \\nensured: \\n(a) \\nelimination or reduction of identified risks and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 as \\nfar as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk \\nAI system;  \\n(b)  where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures \\naddressing risks that cannot be eliminated; \\n(c) \\nprovision of the required information pursuant to Article 13, referred to in paragraph \\n2, point (b) of this Article, and, where appropriate, training to deployers. \\nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, \\ndue consideration shall be given to the technical knowledge, experience, education, \\ntraining to be expected by the deployer and the presumable context in which the system is \\nintended to be used. \\n5. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be tested for the purposes of identifying the most appropriate \\nand targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems \\nperform consistently for their intended purpose and they are in compliance with the \\nrequirements set out in this Chapter. \\n6. \\nTesting procedures may include testing in real world conditions in accordance with Article \\n54a. \\n7. \\nThe testing of the high-risk AI systems shall be performed, as appropriate, at any point in \\ntime throughout the development process, and, in any event, prior to the placing on the \\nmarket or the putting into service. Testing shall be made against prior defined metrics and \\nprobabilistic thresholds that are appropriate to the intended purpose of the high-risk AI \\nsystem. \\n8. \\nWhen implementing the risk management system described in paragraphs 1 to 6, providers \\nshall give consideration to whether in view of its intended purpose the high-risk AI system \\nis likely to adversely impact persons under the age of 18 and, as appropriate, other \\nvulnerable groups of people. \\n9. \\nFor providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements regarding internal \\nrisk management processes under relevant sectorial Union law, the aspects described in \\nparagraphs 1 to 8 may be part of or combined with the risk management procedures \\nestablished pursuant to that law. \\nArticle 10 \\nData and data governance \\n1. \\nHigh-risk AI systems which make use of techniques involving the training of models with \\ndata shall be developed on the basis of training, validation and testing data sets that meet \\nthe quality criteria referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5 whenever such datasets are used. \\n2. \\nTraining, validation and testing data sets shall be subject to appropriate data governance \\nand management practices appropriate for the intended purpose of the AI system. Those \\npractices shall concern in particular: \\n(a) \\nthe relevant design choices; \\n(aa)  data collection processes and origin of data, and in the case of personal data, the \\noriginal purpose of data collection; \\n(c) \\nrelevant data preparation processing operations, such as annotation, labelling, \\ncleaning, updating, enrichment and aggregation; \\n(d) \\nthe formulation of assumptions, notably with respect to the information that the data \\nare supposed to measure and represent; \\n(e) \\nan assessment of the availability, quantity and suitability of the data sets that are \\nneeded; \\n(f) \\nexamination in view of possible biases that are likely to affect the health and safety \\nof persons, negatively impact fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited \\nunder Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future \\noperations; \\n(fa)  appropriate measures to detect, prevent and mitigate possible biases identified \\naccording to point (f); \\n(g) \\nthe identification of relevant data gaps or shortcomings that prevent compliance with \\nthis Regulation, and how those gaps and shortcomings can be addressed. \\n3. \\nTraining, validation and testing datasets shall be relevant, sufficiently representative, and \\nto the best extent possible, free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose. \\nThey shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as \\nregards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI system is \\nintended to be used.  These characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of \\nindividual data sets or a combination thereof. \\n4. \\nDatasets shall take into account, to the extent required by the intended purpose, the \\ncharacteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual, \\nbehavioural or functional setting within which the high-risk AI system is intended to be \\nused. \\n5. \\nTo the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purposes of ensuring bias detection and \\ncorrection in relation to the high-risk AI systems in accordance with the second paragraph, \\npoint f and fa, the providers of such systems may exceptionally process special categories \\nof personal data referred to in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 10 of \\nDirective (EU) 2016/680 and Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, subject to \\nappropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. In \\naddition to provisions set out in the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 \\nand Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, all the following conditions shall apply in order for such \\nprocessing to occur: \\n(a) \\nthe bias detection and correction cannot be effectively fulfilled by processing other \\ndata, including synthetic or anonymised data; \\n(b) \\nthe special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are \\nsubject to technical limitations on the re-use of the personal data and state of the art \\nsecurity and privacy-preserving measures, including pseudonymisation; \\n(c) \\nthe special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are \\nsubject to measures to ensure that the personal data processed are secured, protected, \\nsubject to suitable safeguards, including strict controls and documentation of the \\naccess, to avoid misuse and ensure only authorised persons have access to those \\npersonal data with appropriate confidentiality obligations; \\n(d) \\nthe special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are \\nnot to be transmitted, transferred or otherwise accessed by other parties; \\n(e) \\nthe special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are \\ndeleted once the bias has been corrected or the personal data has reached the end of \\nits retention period, whatever comes first; \\n(f)   \\nthe records of processing activities pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive \\n(EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 includes justification why the \\nprocessing of special categories of personal data was strictly necessary to detect and \\ncorrect biases and this objective could not be achieved by processing other data. \\n6. \\nFor the development of high-risk AI systems not using techniques involving the training of \\nmodels, paragraphs 2 to 5 shall apply only to the testing data sets. \\nArticle 11 \\nTechnical documentation  \\n1. \\nThe technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system \\nis placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to date. \\nThe technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way to demonstrate that the high-\\nrisk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Chapter and provide national \\ncompetent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a clear and \\ncomprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those requirements. It \\nshall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex IV. SMEs, including start-ups, \\nmay provide the elements of the technical documentation specified in Annex IV in a \\nsimplified manner. For this purpose, the Commission shall establish a simplified technical \\ndocumentation form targeted at the needs of small and micro enterprises. Where an SME, \\nincluding start-ups, opts to provide the information required in Annex IV in a simplified \\nmanner, it shall use the form referred to in this paragraph. Notified bodies shall accept the \\nform for the purpose of conformity assessment. \\n2. \\nWhere a high-risk AI system related to a product, to which the legal acts listed in Annex II, \\nsection A apply, is placed on the market or put into service one single technical \\ndocumentation shall be drawn up containing all the information set out in paragraph 1 as \\nwell as the information required under those legal acts. \\n3. \\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to \\namend Annex IV where necessary to ensure that, in the light of technical progress, the \\ntechnical documentation provides all the necessary information to assess the compliance of \\nthe system with the requirements set out in this Chapter. \\nArticle 12 \\nRecord-keeping \\n1. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall technically allow for the automatic recording of events (‘logs’) \\nover the duration of the lifetime of the system. \\n2. \\nIn order to ensure a level of traceability of the AI system’s functioning that is appropriate \\nto the intended purpose of the system, logging capabilities shall enable the recording of \\nevents relevant for: \\n(i) identification of situations that may result in the AI system presenting a risk within the \\nmeaning of Article 65(1) or in a substantial modification;  \\n(ii) facilitation of the post-market monitoring referred to in Article 61; and  \\n(iii) monitoring of the operation of high-risk AI systems referred to in Article 29(4). \\n4. \\nFor high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, point (a) of Annex III, the logging \\ncapabilities shall provide, at a minimum: \\n(a) \\nrecording of the period of each use of the system (start date and time and end date \\nand time of each use); \\n(b) \\nthe reference database against which input data has been checked by the system; \\n(c) \\nthe input data for which the search has led to a match; \\n(d) \\nthe identification of the natural persons involved in the verification of the results, as \\nreferred to in Article 14 (5). \\nArticle 13 \\nTransparency and provision of information to deployers \\n1. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way to ensure that their \\noperation is sufficiently transparent to enable deployers to interpret the system’s output and \\nuse it appropriately. An appropriate type and degree of transparency shall be ensured with \\na view to achieving compliance with the relevant obligations of the provider and deployer \\nset out in Chapter 3 of this Title. \\n2. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be accompanied by instructions for use in an appropriate digital \\nformat or otherwise that include concise, complete, correct and clear information that is \\nrelevant, accessible and comprehensible to users. \\n3. \\nThe instructions for use shall contain at least the following information: \\n(a) \\nthe identity and the contact details of the provider and, where applicable, of its \\nauthorised representative; \\n(b) \\nthe characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance of the high-risk AI \\nsystem, including: \\n(i) \\nits intended purpose; \\n(ii) \\nthe level of accuracy, including its metrics, robustness and cybersecurity \\nreferred to in Article 15 against which the high-risk AI system has been tested \\nand validated and which can be expected, and any known and foreseeable \\ncircumstances that may have an impact on that expected level of accuracy, \\nrobustness and cybersecurity; \\n(iii)  any known or foreseeable circumstance, related to the use of the high-risk AI \\nsystem in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of \\nreasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety \\nor fundamental rights referred to in Article 9(2); \\n(iiia)  where applicable, the technical capabilities and characteristics of the AI system \\nto provide information that is relevant to explain its output;  \\n(iv)  when appropriate, its performance regarding specific persons or groups of \\npersons on which the system is intended to be used; \\n(v)  when appropriate, specifications for the input data, or any other relevant \\ninformation in terms of the training, validation and testing data sets used, \\ntaking into account the intended purpose of the AI system; \\n(va)  where applicable, information to enable deployers to interpret the system’s \\noutput and use it appropriately. \\n(c) \\nthe changes to the high-risk AI system and its performance which have been pre-\\ndetermined by the provider at the moment of the initial conformity assessment, if \\nany; \\n(d) \\nthe human oversight measures referred to in Article 14, including the technical \\nmeasures put in place to facilitate the interpretation of the outputs of AI systems by \\nthe deployers; \\n(e) \\nthe computational and hardware resources needed, the expected lifetime of the high-\\nrisk AI system and any necessary maintenance and care measures, including their \\nfrequency, to ensure the proper functioning of that AI system, including as regards \\nsoftware updates; \\n(ea)  where relevant, a description of the mechanisms included within the AI system that \\nallows users to properly collect, store and interpret the logs in accordance with \\nArticle 12. \\nArticle 14 \\nHuman oversight \\n1. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with \\nappropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural \\npersons during the period in which the AI system is in use. \\n2. \\nHuman oversight shall aim at preventing or minimising the risks to health, safety or \\nfundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with \\nits intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, in particular \\nwhen such risks persist notwithstanding the application of other requirements set out in this \\nChapter. \\n3. \\nThe oversight measures shall be commensurate to the risks, level of autonomy and context \\nof use of the AI system and shall be ensured through either one or all of the following \\ntypes of measures: \\n(a)  measures identified and built, when technically feasible, into the high-risk AI system \\nby the provider before it is placed on the market or put into service;  \\n(b)  measures identified by the provider before placing the high-risk AI system on the \\nmarket or putting it into service and that are appropriate to be implemented by the \\nuser. \\n4. \\nFor the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1 to 3, the high-risk AI system shall be \\nprovided to the user in such a way that natural persons to whom human oversight is \\nassigned are enabled, as appropriate and proportionate to the circumstances: \\n(a) \\nto properly understand the relevant capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI \\nsystem and be able to duly monitor its operation, also in view of detecting and \\naddressing anomalies, dysfunctions and unexpected performance; \\n(b) \\nto remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on \\nthe output produced by a high-risk AI system (‘automation bias’), in particular for \\nhigh-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for decisions \\nto be taken by natural persons; \\n(c) \\nto correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output, taking into account for \\nexample the interpretation tools and methods available; \\n(d) \\nto decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or otherwise \\ndisregard, override or reverse the output of the high-risk AI system; \\n(e) \\nto intervene on the operation of the high-risk AI system or interrupt, the system \\nthrough a \"stop\" button or a similar procedure that allows the system to come to a \\nhalt in a safe state. \\n5. \\nFor high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a) of Annex III, the measures referred to in \\nparagraph 3 shall be such as to ensure that, in addition, no action or decision is taken by the \\ndeployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been \\nseparately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons with the necessary \\ncompetence, training and authority.  \\nThe requirement for a separate verification by at least two natural persons shall not apply \\nto high risk AI systems used for the purpose of law enforcement, migration, border control \\nor asylum, in cases where Union or national law considers the application of this \\nrequirement to be disproportionate. \\nArticle 15 \\nAccuracy, robustness and cybersecurity \\n1. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way that they achieve an \\nappropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity, and perform consistently in \\nthose respects throughout their lifecycle. \\n1a. \\nTo address the technical aspects of how to measure the appropriate levels of accuracy and \\nrobustness set out in paragraph 1 of this Article and any other relevant performance \\nmetrics, the Commission shall, in cooperation with relevant stakeholder and organisations \\nsuch as metrology and benchmarking authorities, encourage as appropriate, the \\ndevelopment of benchmarks and measurement methodologies. \\n2. \\nThe levels of accuracy and the relevant accuracy metrics of high-risk AI systems shall be \\ndeclared in the accompanying instructions of use. \\n3. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be as resilient as possible regarding errors, faults or \\ninconsistencies that may occur within the system or the environment in which the system \\noperates, in particular due to their interaction with natural persons or other systems. \\nTechnical and organisational measures shall be taken towards this regard. \\nThe robustness of high-risk AI systems may be achieved through technical redundancy \\nsolutions, which may include backup or fail-safe plans. \\nHigh-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into \\nservice shall be developed in such a way to eliminate or reduce as far as possible the risk of \\npossibly biased outputs influencing input for future operations (‘feedback loops’) are duly \\naddressed with appropriate mitigation measures. \\n4. \\nHigh-risk AI systems shall be resilient as regards to attempts by unauthorised third parties \\nto alter their use, outputs or performance by exploiting the system vulnerabilities. \\nThe technical solutions aimed at ensuring the cybersecurity of high-risk AI systems shall \\nbe appropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks. \\nThe technical solutions to address AI specific vulnerabilities shall include, where \\nappropriate, measures to prevent, detect, respond to, resolve and control for attacks trying \\nto manipulate the training dataset (‘data poisoning’), or pre-trained components used in \\ntraining (‘model poisoning’), inputs designed to cause the model to make a mistake \\n(‘adversarial examples’ or ‘model evasion’), confidentiality attacks or model flaws. \\nChapter 3 \\nOBLIGATIONS OF PROVIDERS AND DEPLOYERS OF HIGH-\\nRISK AI SYSTEMS AND OTHER PARTIES \\nArticle 16 \\nObligations of providers of high-risk AI systems  \\nProviders of high-risk AI systems shall: \\n(a) \\nensure that their high-risk AI systems are compliant with the requirements set out in \\nChapter 2 of this Title;

It shall provide a copy of the mandate to the market surveillance \\nauthorities upon request, in one of the official languages of the institution of the Union \\ndetermined by the national competent authority. For the purpose of this Regulation, the \\nmandate shall empower the authorised representative to carry out the following tasks: \\n(-a)  verify that the EU declaration of conformity and the technical documentation have \\nbeen drawn up and that an appropriate conformity assessment procedure has been \\ncarried out by the provider; \\n(a) \\nkeep at the disposal of the national competent authorities and national authorities \\nreferred to in Article 63(7), for a period ending 10 years after the high-risk AI system \\nhas been placed on the market or put into service, the contact details of the provider \\nby which the authorised representative has been appointed, a copy of the EU \\ndeclaration of conformity, the technical documentation and, if applicable, the \\ncertificate issued by the notified body; \\n(b)  provide a national competent authority, upon a reasoned request, with all the \\ninformation and documentation, including that kept according to point (a), necessary \\nto demonstrate the conformity of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out \\nin Chapter 2 of this Title, including access to the logs, as referred to in Article 12(1), \\nautomatically generated by the high-risk AI system to the extent such logs are under \\nthe control of the provider; \\n(c) \\ncooperate with competent authorities, upon a reasoned request, on any action the \\nlatter takes in relation to the high-risk AI system, in particular to reduce and mitigate \\nthe risks posed by the high-risk AI system; \\n(ca)  where applicable, comply with the registration obligations referred in Article 51(1), \\nor, if the registration is carried out by the provider itself, ensure that the information \\nreferred to in [point 3] of Annex VIII is correct. \\nThe mandate shall empower the authorised representative to be addressed, in addition to or \\ninstead of the provider, by the competent authorities, on all issues related to ensuring \\ncompliance with this Regulation.  \\n2b. \\nThe authorised representative shall terminate the mandate if it considers or has reason to \\nconsider that the provider acts contrary to its obligations under this Regulation. In such a \\ncase, it shall also immediately inform the market surveillance authority of the Member \\nState in which it is established, as well as, where applicable, the relevant notified body, \\nabout the termination of the mandate and the reasons thereof. \\nArticle 26 \\nObligations of importers \\n1. \\nBefore placing a high-risk AI system on the market, importers of such system shall ensure \\nthat such a system is in conformity with this Regulation by verifying that: \\n(a) \\nthe relevant conformity assessment procedure referred to in Article 43 has been \\ncarried out by the provider of that AI system; \\n(b) \\nthe provider has drawn up the technical documentation in accordance with Article 11 \\nand Annex IV; \\n(c) \\nthe system bears the required CE conformity marking and is accompanied by the EU \\ndeclaration of conformity and instructions of use; \\n(ca) \\nthe provider has appointed an authorised representative in accordance with Article \\n25(1). \\n2. \\nWhere an importer has sufficient reason to consider that a high-risk AI system is not in \\nconformity with this Regulation, or is falsified, or accompanied by falsified \\ndocumentation, it shall not place that system on the market until that AI system has been \\nbrought into conformity. Where the high-risk AI system presents a risk within the meaning \\nof Article 65(1), the importer shall inform the provider of the AI system, the authorised \\nrepresentatives and the market surveillance authorities to that effect.  \\n3. \\nImporters shall indicate their name, registered trade name or registered trademark, and the \\naddress at which they can be contacted on the high-risk AI system and on its packaging or \\nits accompanying documentation, where applicable. \\n4. \\nImporters shall ensure that, while a high-risk AI system is under their responsibility, where \\napplicable, storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise its compliance with the \\nrequirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title. \\n4a. \\nImporters shall keep, for a period ending 10 years after the AI system has been placed on \\nthe market or put into service, a copy of the certificate issued by the notified body, where \\napplicable, of the instructions for use and of the EU declaration of conformity. \\n5. \\nImporters shall provide national competent authorities, upon a reasoned request, with all \\nthe necessary information and documentation including that kept in accordance with \\nparagraph 4a to demonstrate the conformity of a high-risk AI system with the requirements \\nset out in Chapter 2 of this Title in a language which can be easily understood by them. To \\nthis purpose they shall also ensure that the technical documentation can be made available \\nto those authorities.  \\n5a. \\nImporters shall cooperate with national competent authorities on any action those \\nauthorities take, in particular to reduce and mitigate the risks posed by the high-risk AI \\nsystem. \\nArticle 27 \\nObligations of distributors \\n1. \\nBefore making a high-risk AI system available on the market, distributors shall verify that \\nthe high-risk AI system bears the required CE conformity marking, that it is accompanied \\nby a copy of EU declaration of conformity and instruction of use, and that the provider and \\nthe importer of the system, as applicable, have complied with their obligations set out in \\nArticle 16, point (aa) and (b) and 26(3) respectively. \\n2. \\nWhere a distributor considers or has reason to consider, on the basis of the information in \\nits possession, that a high-risk AI system is not in conformity with the requirements set out \\nin Chapter 2 of this Title, it shall not make the high-risk AI system available on the market \\nuntil that system has been brought into conformity with those requirements. Furthermore, \\nwhere the system presents a risk within the meaning of Article 65(1), the distributor shall \\ninform the provider or the importer of the system, as applicable, to that effect.  \\n3. \\nDistributors shall ensure that, while a high-risk AI system is under their responsibility, \\nwhere applicable, storage or transport conditions do not jeopardise the compliance of the \\nsystem with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title. \\n4. \\nA distributor that considers or has reason to consider, on the basis of the information in its \\npossession, that a high-risk AI system which it has made available on the market is not in \\nconformity with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title shall take the corrective \\nactions necessary to bring that system into conformity with those requirements, to \\nwithdraw it or recall it or shall ensure that the provider, the importer or any relevant \\noperator, as appropriate, takes those corrective actions. Where the high-risk AI system \\npresents a risk within the meaning of Article 65(1), the distributor shall immediately \\ninform the provider or importer of the system and the national competent authorities of the \\nMember States in which it has made the product available to that effect, giving details, in \\nparticular, of the non-compliance and of any corrective actions taken.  \\n5. \\nUpon a reasoned request from a national competent authority, distributors of the high-risk \\nAI system shall provide that authority with all the information and documentation \\nregarding its activities as described in paragraph 1 to 4 necessary to demonstrate the \\nconformity of a high-risk system with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title.  \\n5a. \\nDistributors shall cooperate with national competent authorities on any action those \\nauthorities take in relation to an AI system, of which they are the distributor, in particular \\nto reduce or mitigate the risk posed by the high-risk AI system. \\nArticle 28 \\nResponsibilities along the AI value chain  \\n1. \\nAny distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party shall be considered a provider of a \\nhigh-risk AI system for the purposes of this Regulation and shall be subject to the \\nobligations of the provider under Article 16, in any of the following circumstances: \\n(a) \\nthey put their name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the \\nmarket or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating \\nthat the obligations are allocated otherwise; \\n(b) \\nthey make a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has already been \\nplaced on the market or has already been put into service and in a way that it remains \\na high-risk AI system in accordance with Article 6; \\n(ba)  they modify the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general purpose AI \\nsystem, which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the \\nmarket or put into service in such manner that the AI system becomes a high risk AI \\nsystem in accordance with Article 6. \\n2. \\nWhere the circumstances referred to in paragraph 1, point (a) to (ba) occur, the provider \\nthat initially placed the AI system on the market or put it into service shall no longer be \\nconsidered a provider of that specific AI system for the purposes of this Regulation. This \\nformer provider shall closely cooperate and shall make available the necessary information \\nand provide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required \\nfor the fulfilment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in particular regarding the \\ncompliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems. This paragraph shall \\nnot apply in the cases where the former provider has expressly excluded the change of its \\nsystem into a high-risk system and therefore the obligation to hand over the \\ndocumentation. \\n2a. \\nFor high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products to which the legal acts \\nlisted in Annex II, section A apply, the manufacturer of those products shall be considered \\nthe provider of the high-risk AI system and shall be subject to the obligations under Article \\n16 under either of the following scenarios: \\n(i)   the high-risk AI system is placed on the market together with the product under the \\nname or trademark of the product manufacturer;   \\n(ii)   the high-risk AI system is put into service under the name or trademark of the product \\nmanufacturer after the product has been placed on the market. \\n2b.  \\nThe provider of a high risk AI system and the third party that supplies an AI system, tools, \\nservices, components, or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI system \\nshall, by written agreement, specify the necessary information, capabilities, technical \\naccess and other assistance based on the generally acknowledged state of the art, in order \\nto enable the provider of the high risk AI system to fully comply with the obligations set \\nout in this Regulation. This obligation shall not apply to third parties making accessible to \\nthe public tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI \\nmodels under a free and open licence. \\nThe AI Office may develop and recommend voluntary model contractual terms between \\nproviders of high-risk AI systems and third parties that supply tools, services, components \\nor processes that are used or integrated in high-risk AI systems. When developing \\nvoluntary model contractual terms, the AI Office shall take into account possible \\ncontractual requirements applicable in specific sectors or business cases. The model \\ncontractual terms shall be published and be available free of charge in an easily usable \\nelectronic format. \\n2b. \\nParagraphs 2 and 2a are without prejudice to the need to respect and protect intellectual \\nproperty rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in accordance with \\nUnion and national law. \\nArticle 29 \\nObligations of deployers of high-risk AI systems \\n1. \\nDeployers of high-risk AI systems shall take appropriate technical and organisational \\nmeasures to ensure they use such systems in accordance with the instructions of use \\naccompanying the systems, pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 5 of this Article. \\n1a. \\nTo the extent deployers exercise control over the high-risk AI system, they shall ensure \\nthat the natural persons assigned to ensure human oversight of the high-risk AI systems \\nhave the necessary competence, training and authority as well as the necessary support.  \\n2. \\nThe obligations in paragraph 1 and 1a, are without prejudice to other deployer obligations \\nunder Union or national law and to the deployer’s discretion in organising its own \\nresources and activities for the purpose of implementing the human oversight measures \\nindicated by the provider. \\n3. \\nWithout prejudice to paragraph 1 and 1a, to the extent the deployer exercises control over \\nthe input data, that deployer shall ensure that input data is relevant and sufficiently \\nrepresentative in view of the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system. \\n4. \\nDeployers shall monitor the operation of the high-risk AI system on the basis of the \\ninstructions of use and when relevant, inform providers in accordance with Article 61. \\nWhen they have reasons to consider that the use in accordance with the instructions of use \\nmay result in the AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of Article 65(1) they \\nshall, without undue delay, inform the provider or distributor and relevant market \\nsurveillance authority and suspend the use of the system. They shall also immediately \\ninform first the provider, and then the importer or distributor and relevant market \\nsurveillance authorities when they have identified any serious incident. If the deployer is \\nnot able to reach the provider, Article 62 shall apply mutatis mutandis. This obligation \\nshall not cover sensitive operational data of deployers of AI systems which are law \\nenforcement authorities. \\nFor deployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal \\ngovernance, arrangements or processes under Union financial services legislation, the \\nmonitoring obligation set out in the first subparagraph shall be deemed to be fulfilled by \\ncomplying with the rules on internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms \\npursuant to the relevant financial service legislation. \\n5. \\nDeployers of high-risk AI systems shall keep the logs automatically generated by that \\nhigh-risk AI system to the extent such logs are under their control for a period appropriate \\nto the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system, of at least six months, unless provided \\notherwise in applicable Union or national law, in particular in Union law on the protection \\nof personal data. \\nDeployers that are financial institutions subject to requirements regarding their internal \\ngovernance, arrangements or processes under Union financial services legislation shall \\nmaintain the logs as part of the documentation kept pursuant to the relevant Union \\nfinancial service legislation. \\n(a)  Prior to putting into service or use a high-risk AI system at the workplace, deployers \\nwho are employers shall inform workers representatives and the affected workers \\nthat they will be subject to the system. This information shall be provided, where \\napplicable, in accordance with the rules and procedures laid down in Union and \\nnational law and practice on information of workers and their representatives. \\n(b)  Deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities or Union institutions, \\nbodies, offices and agencies shall comply with the registration obligations referred to \\nin Article 51. When they find that the system that they envisage to use has not been \\nregistered in the EU database referred to in Article 60 they shall not use that system \\nand shall inform the provider or the distributor. \\n6. \\nWhere applicable, deployers of high-risk AI systems shall use the information provided \\nunder Article 13 to comply with their obligation to carry out a data protection impact \\nassessment under Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) \\n2016/680.  \\n6a. \\nWithout prejudice to Directive (EU) 2016/680, in the framework of an investigation for the \\ntargeted search of a person convicted or suspected of having committed a criminal offence, \\nthe deployer of an AI system for post-remote biometric identification shall request an \\nauthorisation, prior, or without undue delay and no later than 48 hours, by a judicial \\nauthority or an administrative authority whose decision is binding and subject to judicial \\nreview, for the use of the system, except when the system is used for the initial \\nidentification of a potential suspect based on objective and verifiable facts directly linked \\nto the offence. Each use shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for the investigation \\nof a specific criminal offence. \\nIf the requested authorisation provided for in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is \\nrejected, the use of the post remote biometric identification system linked to that \\nauthorisation shall be stopped with immediate effect and the personal data linked to the use \\nof the system for which the authorisation was requested shall be deleted. \\nIn any case, such AI system for post remote biometric identification shall not be used for \\nlaw enforcement purposes in an untargeted way, without any link to a criminal offence, a \\ncriminal proceeding,  a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a criminal \\noffence  or the search for a specific missing person. \\nIt shall be ensured that no decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person may \\nbe taken by the law enforcement authorities solely based on the output of these post remote \\nbiometric identification systems. \\nThis paragraph is without prejudice to the provisions of Article 10 of the Directive (EU) \\n2016/680 and Article 9 of the GDPR for the processing of biometric data. \\nRegardless of the purpose or deployer, each use of these systems shall be documented in \\nthe relevant police file and shall be made available to the relevant market surveillance \\nauthority and the national data protection authority upon request, excluding the disclosure \\nof sensitive operational data related to law enforcement. This subparagraph shall be \\nwithout prejudice to the powers conferred by the Directive 2016/680 to supervisory \\nauthorities. \\nDeployers shall, in addition, submit annual reports to the relevant market surveillance and \\nnational data protection authorities on the uses of post-remote biometric identification \\nsystems, excluding the disclosure of sensitive operational data related to law enforcement. \\nThe reports can be aggregated to cover several deployments in one operation.  \\nMember States may introduce, in accordance with Union law, more restrictive laws on the \\nuse of post remote biometric identification systems. \\n6b. \\nWithout prejudice to Article 52, deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III \\nthat make decisions or assist in making decisions related to natural persons shall inform the \\nnatural persons that they are subject to the use of the high-risk AI system. For high risk AI \\nsystems used for law enforcement purposes Article 13 of Directive 2016/680 shall apply. \\n6c. \\nDeployers shall cooperate with the relevant national competent authorities on any action \\nthose authorities take in relation with the high-risk system in order to implement this \\nRegulation. \\nArticle 29a \\nFundamental rights impact assessment for high-risk AI systems \\n1.   Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system as defined in Article 6(2), with the exception of \\nAI  \\nsystems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of Annex III, deployers that are \\nbodies governed by public law or private operators providing public services and operators \\ndeploying high-risk systems referred to in Annex III, point 5, (b) and (ca) shall perform an \\nassessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of the system may produce.  For \\nthat purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of: \\n(a)     a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be  \\nused in line with its intended purpose; \\n(b)     a description of the period of time and frequency in which each high-risk AI system \\nis intended to be used; \\n(c)     the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the  \\nspecific context; \\n(d)     the specific risks of harm likely to impact the categories of persons or group of  \\npersons identified pursuant point (c), taking into account the information given by \\nthe provider pursuant to Article 13; \\n(e)     a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the \\ninstructions of use; \\n(f)  \\nthe measures to be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including their \\narrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms.  \\n2.   The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 applies to the first use of the high-risk AI system. \\nThe deployer may, in similar cases, rely on previously conducted fundamental rights impact \\nassessments or existing impact assessments carried out by provider. If, during the use of the \\nhigh-risk AI system, the deployer considers that any of the factors listed in paragraph 1 \\nchange are or no longer up to date, the deployer will take the necessary steps to update the \\ninformation. \\n3.   Once the impact assessment has been performed, the deployer shall notify the market \\nsurveillance authority of the results of the assessment, submitting the filled template referred \\nto in paragraph 5 as a part of the notification. In the case referred to in Article 47(1), \\ndeployers may be exempted from these obligations. \\n4.  \\nIf any of the obligations laid down in this article are already met through the data protection \\nimpact assessment conducted pursuant to Article 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article \\n27 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, the fundamental rights impact assessment referred to in \\nparagraph 1 shall be conducted in conjunction with that data protection impact assessment. \\n5.   The AI Office shall develop a template for a questionnaire, including through an automated \\ntool, to facilitate deployers to implement the obligations of this Article in a simplified \\nmanner. \\nNOTIFIYING AUTHORITIES AND NOTIFIED BODIES \\nChapter 4 \\nArticle 30 \\nNotifying authorities \\n1. \\nEach Member State shall designate or establish at least one notifying authority responsible \\nfor setting up and carrying out the necessary procedures for the assessment, designation \\nand notification of conformity assessment bodies and for their monitoring. These \\nprocedures shall be developed in cooperation between the notifying authorities of all \\nMember States. \\n2. \\nMember States may decide that the assessment and monitoring referred to in paragraph 1 \\nshall be carried out by a national accreditation body within the meaning of and in \\naccordance with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. \\n3. \\nNotifying authorities shall be established, organised and operated in such a way that no \\nconflict of interest arises with conformity assessment bodies and the objectivity and \\nimpartiality of their activities are safeguarded. \\n4. \\nNotifying authorities shall be organised in such a way that decisions relating to the \\nnotification of conformity assessment bodies are taken by competent persons different \\nfrom those who carried out the assessment of those bodies. \\n5. \\nNotifying authorities shall not offer or provide any activities that conformity assessment \\nbodies perform or any consultancy services on a commercial or competitive basis. \\n6. \\nNotifying authorities shall safeguard the confidentiality of the information they obtain in \\naccordance with Article 70. \\n7. \\nNotifying authorities shall have an adequate number of competent personnel at their \\ndisposal for the proper performance of their tasks. Competent personnel shall have the \\nnecessary expertise, where applicable, for their function, in fields such as information \\ntechnologies, artificial intelligence and law, including the supervision of fundamental \\nrights. \\nArticle 31 \\nApplication of a conformity assessment body for notification  \\n1. \\nConformity assessment bodies shall submit an application for notification to the notifying \\nauthority of the Member State in which they are established. \\n2. \\nThe application for notification shall be accompanied by a description of the conformity \\nassessment activities, the conformity assessment module or modules and the types of AI \\nsystems for which the conformity assessment body claims to be competent, as well as by \\nan accreditation certificate, where one exists, issued by a national accreditation body \\nattesting that the conformity assessment body fulfils the requirements laid down in Article \\n33. Any valid document related to existing designations of the applicant notified body \\nunder any other Union harmonisation legislation shall be added. \\n3. \\nWhere the conformity assessment body concerned cannot provide an accreditation \\ncertificate, it shall provide the notifying authority with all the documentary evidence \\nnecessary for the verification, recognition and regular monitoring of its compliance with \\nthe requirements laid down in Article 33. For notified bodies which are designated under \\nany other Union harmonisation legislation, all documents and certificates linked to those \\ndesignations may be used to support their designation procedure under this Regulation, as \\nappropriate. The notified body shall update the documentation referred to in paragraph 2 \\nand paragraph 3 whenever relevant changes occur, in order to enable the authority \\nresponsible for notified bodies to monitor and verify continuous compliance with all the \\nrequirements laid down in Article 33. \\nArticle 32 \\nNotification procedure \\n1. \\nNotifying authorities may only notify conformity assessment bodies which have satisfied \\nthe requirements laid down in Article 33. \\n2. \\nNotifying authorities shall notify the Commission and the other Member States using the \\nelectronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission of each conformity \\nassessment body referred to in paragraph 1. \\n3. \\nThe notification referred to in paragraph 2 shall include full details of the conformity \\nassessment activities, the conformity assessment module or modules and the types of AI \\nsystems concerned and the relevant attestation of competence. Where a notification is not \\nbased on an accreditation certificate as referred to in Article 31 (2), the notifying authority \\nshall provide the Commission and the other Member States with documentary evidence \\nwhich attests to the conformity assessment body\\'s competence and the arrangements in \\nplace to ensure that that body will be monitored regularly and will continue to satisfy the \\nrequirements laid down in Article 33. \\n4. \\nThe conformity assessment body concerned may perform the activities of a notified body \\nonly where no objections are raised by the Commission or the other Member States within \\ntwo weeks of a notification by a notifying authority where it includes an accreditation \\ncertificate referred to in Article 31(2), or within two months of a notification by the \\nnotifying authority where it includes documentary evidence referred to in Article 31(3). \\n4a. \\nWhere objections are raised, the Commission shall without delay enter into consultation \\nwith the relevant Member States and the conformity assessment body. In view thereof, the \\nCommission shall decide whether the authorisation is justified or not. The Commission \\nshall address its decision to the Member State concerned and the relevant conformity \\nassessment body. \\nArticle 33 \\nRequirements relating to notified bodies  \\n1. \\nA notified body shall be established under national law of a Member State and have legal \\npersonality. \\n2. \\nNotified bodies shall satisfy the organisational, quality management, resources and process \\nrequirements that are necessary to fulfil their tasks, as well as suitable cybersecurity \\nrequirements. \\n3. \\nThe organisational structure, allocation of responsibilities, reporting lines and operation of \\nnotified bodies shall be such as to ensure that there is confidence in the performance by \\nand in the results of the conformity assessment activities that the notified bodies conduct. \\n4. \\nNotified bodies shall be independent of the provider of a high-risk AI system in relation to \\nwhich it performs conformity assessment activities. Notified bodies shall also be \\nindependent of any other operator having an economic interest in the high-risk AI system \\nthat is assessed, as well as of any competitors of the provider. This shall not preclude the \\nuse of assessed AI systems that are necessary for the operations of the conformity \\nassessment body or the use of such systems for personal purposes. \\n4a. \\nA conformity assessment body, its top-level management and the personnel responsible for \\ncarrying out the conformity assessment tasks shall not be directly involved in the design, \\ndevelopment, marketing or use of high-risk AI systems, or represent the parties engaged in \\nthose activities. They shall not engage in any activity that may conflict with their \\nindependence of judgement or integrity in relation to conformity assessment activities for \\nwhich they are notified. This shall in particular apply to consultancy services. \\n5. \\nNotified bodies shall be organised and operated so as to safeguard the independence, \\nobjectivity and impartiality of their activities. Notified bodies shall document and \\nimplement a structure and procedures to safeguard impartiality and to promote and apply \\nthe principles of impartiality throughout their organisation, personnel and assessment \\nactivities. \\n6. \\nNotified bodies shall have documented procedures in place ensuring that their personnel, \\ncommittees, subsidiaries, subcontractors and any associated body or personnel of external \\nbodies respect the confidentiality of the information in accordance with Article 70 which \\ncomes into their possession during the performance of conformity assessment activities, \\nexcept when disclosure is required by law. The staff of notified bodies shall be bound to \\nobserve professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their \\ntasks under this Regulation, except in relation to the notifying authorities of the Member \\nState in which their activities are carried out. \\n7. \\nNotified bodies shall have procedures for the performance of activities which take due \\naccount of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it operates, its structure, the \\ndegree of complexity of the AI system in question. \\n8. \\nNotified bodies shall take out appropriate liability insurance for their conformity \\nassessment activities, unless liability is assumed by the Member State in which they are \\nestablished in accordance with national law or that Member State is itself directly \\nresponsible for the conformity assessment. \\n9. \\nNotified bodies shall be capable of carrying out all the tasks falling to them under this \\nRegulation with the highest degree of professional integrity and the requisite competence \\nin the specific field, whether those tasks are carried out by notified bodies themselves or on \\ntheir behalf and under their responsibility. \\n10. \\nNotified bodies shall have sufficient internal competences to be able to effectively evaluate \\nthe tasks conducted by external parties on their behalf. The notified body shall have \\npermanent availability of sufficient administrative, technical, legal and scientific personnel \\nwho possess experience and knowledge relating to the relevant types of artificial \\nintelligence systems, data and data computing and to the requirements set out in Chapter 2 \\nof this Title. \\n11. \\nNotified bodies shall participate in coordination activities as referred to in Article 38. They \\nshall also take part directly or be represented in European standardisation organisations, or \\nensure that they are aware and up to date in respect of relevant standards. \\nArticle 33a \\nPresumption of conformity with requirements relating to notified bodies  \\nWhere a conformity assessment body demonstrates its conformity with the criteria laid \\ndown in the relevant harmonised standards or parts thereof the references of which have \\nbeen published in the Official Journal of the European Union it shall be presumed to \\ncomply with the requirements set out in Article 33 in so far as the applicable harmonised \\nstandards cover those requirements. \\nArticle 34 \\nSubsidiaries of and subcontracting by notified bodies \\n1. \\nWhere a notified body subcontracts specific tasks connected with the conformity \\nassessment or has recourse to a subsidiary, it shall ensure that the subcontractor or the \\nsubsidiary meets the requirements laid down in Article 33 and shall inform the notifying \\nauthority accordingly. \\n2. \\nNotified bodies shall take full responsibility for the tasks performed by subcontractors or \\nsubsidiaries wherever these are established. \\n3. \\nActivities may be subcontracted or carried out by a subsidiary only with the agreement of \\nthe provider. Notified bodies shall make a list of their subsidiaries publicly available. \\n4. \\nThe relevant documents concerning the assessment of the qualifications of the \\nsubcontractor or the subsidiary and the work carried out by them under this Regulation \\nshall be kept at the disposal of the notifying authority for a period of 5 years from the \\ntermination date of the subcontracting activity. \\nArticle 34a \\nOperational obligations of notified bodies \\n1. \\nNotified bodies shall verify the conformity of high-risk AI system in accordance with the \\nconformity assessment procedures referred to in Article 43. \\n2. \\nNotified bodies shall perform their activities while avoiding unnecessary burdens for \\nproviders, and taking due account of the size of an undertaking, the sector in which it \\noperates, its structure and the degree of complexity of the high risk AI system in question. \\nIn so doing, the notified body shall nevertheless respect the degree of rigour and the level \\nof protection required for the compliance of the high risk AI system with the requirements \\nof this Regulation. Particular attention shall be paid to minimising administrative burdens \\nand compliance costs for micro and small enterprises as defined in Commission \\nRecommendation 2003/361/EC. \\n3. \\nNotified bodies shall make available and submit upon request all relevant documentation, \\nincluding the providers’ documentation, to the notifying authority referred to in Article 30 \\nto allow that authority to conduct its assessment, designation, notification, monitoring \\nactivities and to facilitate the assessment outlined in this Chapter. \\nArticle 35 \\nIdentification numbers and lists of notified bodies designated under this Regulation \\n1. \\nThe Commission shall assign an identification number to notified bodies. It shall assign a \\nsingle number, even where a body is notified under several Union acts. \\n2. \\nThe Commission shall make publicly available the list of the bodies notified under this \\nRegulation, including the identification numbers that have been assigned to them and the \\nactivities for which they have been notified. The Commission shall ensure that the list is \\nkept up to date. \\nArticle 36 \\nChanges to notifications \\n-1. \\nThe notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any \\nrelevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool \\nreferred to in Article 32(2). \\n-1a. \\nThe procedures described in Article 31 and 32 shall apply to extensions of the scope of the \\nnotification. For changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the \\nprocedures laid down in the following paragraphs shall apply. \\nWhere a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities it shall inform \\nthe notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and in the case of a \\nplanned cessation one year before ceasing its activities. The certificates may remain valid \\nfor a temporary period of nine months after cessation of the notified body\\'s activities on \\ncondition that another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume \\nresponsibilities for the AI systems covered by those certificates. The new notified body \\nshall complete a full assessment of the AI systems affected by the end of that period before \\nissuing new certificates for those systems. Where the notified body has ceased its activity, \\nthe notifying authority shall withdraw the designation. \\n1. \\nWhere a notifying authority has sufficient reasons to consider that a notified body no \\nlonger meets the requirements laid down in Article 33, or that it is failing to fulfil its \\nobligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with the \\nutmost diligence. In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the \\nobjections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known. If the notifying \\nauthority comes to the conclusion that the notified body no longer meets the requirements \\nlaid down in Article 33 or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, it shall restrict, suspend \\nor withdraw notification as appropriate, depending on the seriousness of the failure to meet \\nthose requirements or fulfil those obligations. It shall immediately inform the Commission \\nand the other Member States accordingly. \\n2a. \\nWhere its designation has been suspended, restricted, or fully or partially withdrawn, the \\nnotified body shall inform the manufacturers concerned at the latest within 10 days. \\n2b. \\nIn the event of restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a notification, the notifying \\nauthority shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of the notified body concerned \\nare kept and make them available to notifying authorities in other Member States and to \\nmarket surveillance authorities at their request. \\n2c. \\nIn the event of restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a designation, the notifying \\nauthority shall: \\n(a) \\nassess the impact on the certificates issued by the notified body;  \\n(b) \\nsubmit a report on its findings to the Commission and the other Member States \\nwithin three months of having notified the changes to the notification; \\n(c) \\nrequire the notified body to suspend or withdraw, within a reasonable period of time \\ndetermined by the authority, any certificates which were unduly issued in order to \\nensure the conformity of AI systems on the market;  \\n(d) \\ninform the Commission and the Member States about certificates of which it has \\nrequired their suspension or withdrawal; \\n(e) \\nprovide the national competent authorities of the Member State in which the provider \\nhas its registered place of business with all relevant information about the certificates \\nfor which it has required suspension or withdrawal. That competent authority shall \\ntake the appropriate measures, where necessary, to avoid a potential risk to health, \\nsafety or fundamental rights. \\n2d. \\nWith the exception of certificates unduly issued, and where a notification has been \\nsuspended or restricted, the certificates shall remain valid in the following circumstances: \\n(a) \\nthe notifying authority has confirmed, within one month of the suspension or \\nrestriction, that there is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights in relation to \\ncertificates affected by the suspension or restriction, and the notifying authority has \\noutlined a timeline and actions anticipated to remedy the suspension or restriction; or  \\n(b) \\nthe notifying authority has confirmed that no certificates relevant to the suspension \\nwill be issued, amended or re-issued during the course of the suspension or \\nrestriction, and states whether the notified body has the capability of continuing to \\nmonitor and remain responsible for existing certificates issued for the period of the \\nsuspension or restriction. In the event that the authority responsible for notified \\nbodies determines that the notified body does not have the capability to support \\nexisting certificates issued, the provider shall provide to the national competent \\nauthorities of the Member State in which the provider of the system covered by the \\ncertificate has its registered place of business, within three months of the suspension \\nor restriction, a written confirmation that another qualified notified body is \\ntemporarily assuming the functions of the notified body to monitor and remain \\nresponsible for the certificates during the period of suspension or restriction.  \\n2e. \\nWith the exception of certificates unduly issued, and where a designation has been \\nwithdrawn, the certificates shall remain valid for a period of nine months in the following \\ncircumstances: \\n(a)  where the national competent authority of the Member State in which the provider of \\nthe AI system covered by the certificate has its registered place of business has           \\nconfirmed that there is no risk to health, safety and fundamental rights associated \\nwith the systems in question; and  \\n(b) \\nanother notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume immediate \\nresponsibilities for those systems and will have completed assessment of them within \\ntwelve months of the withdrawal of the designation. \\nIn the circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph, the national competent authority \\nof the Member State in which the provider of the system covered by the certificate has its \\nplace of business may extend the provisional validity of the certificates for further periods \\nof three months, which altogether shall not exceed twelve months. \\n2f. \\nThe national competent authority or the notified body assuming the functions of the \\nnotified body affected by the change of notification shall immediately inform the \\nCommission, the other Member States and the other notified bodies thereof. \\nArticle 37 \\nChallenge to the competence of notified bodies \\n1. \\nThe Commission shall, where necessary, investigate all cases where there are reasons to \\ndoubt the competence of a notified body or the continued fulfilment by a notified body of \\nthe requirements laid down in Article 33 and their applicable responsibilities. \\n2. \\nThe Notifying authority shall provide the Commission, on request, with all relevant \\ninformation relating to the notification or the maintenance of the competence of the \\nnotified body concerned. \\n3. \\nThe Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its \\ninvestigations pursuant to this Article is treated confidentially in accordance with Article \\n70. \\n4. \\nWhere the Commission ascertains that a notified body does not meet or no longer meets \\nthe requirements for its notification, it shall inform the notifying Member State accordingly \\nand request it to take the necessary corrective measures, including suspension or \\nwithdrawal of the notification if necessary. Where the Member State fails to take the \\nnecessary corrective measures, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, \\nsuspend, restrict or withdraw the designation. That implementing act shall be adopted in \\naccordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 74(2). \\nArticle 38 \\nCoordination of notified bodies \\n1. \\nThe Commission shall ensure that, with regard to high-risk AI systems, appropriate \\ncoordination and cooperation between notified bodies active in the conformity assessment \\nprocedures pursuant to this Regulation are put in place and properly operated in the form \\nof a sectoral group of notified bodies. \\n2. \\nThe notifying authority shall ensure that the bodies notified by them participate in the work \\nof that group, directly or by means of designated representatives. \\n2a. \\nThe Commission shall provide for the exchange of knowledge and best practices between \\nthe Member States\\' notifying authorities.  \\nArticle 39 \\nConformity assessment bodies of third countries \\nConformity assessment bodies established under the law of a third country with which the \\nUnion has concluded an agreement may be authorised to carry out the activities of notified \\nBodies under this Regulation, provided that they meet the requirements in Article 33 or \\nthey ensure an equivalent level of compliance. \\nSTANDARDS, CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT, CERTIFICATES, \\nChapter 5 \\nREGISTRATION \\nArticle 40 \\nHarmonised standards and standardisation deliverables \\n 1. \\nHigh-risk AI systems or general purpose AI models which are in conformity with \\nharmonised standards or parts thereof the references of which have been published in the \\nOfficial Journal of the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EU) 1025/2012 \\nshall be presumed to be in conformity with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this \\nTitle or, as applicable, with the requirements set out in [Chapter on GPAI], to the extent \\nthose standards cover those requirements.  \\n2. \\nThe Commission shall issue standardisation requests covering all requirements of Title II \\nChapter III and as applicable [GPAI Chapter] of this Regulation, in accordance with \\nArticle 10 of Regulation EU (No)1025/2012 without undue delay. The standardisation \\nrequest shall also ask for deliverables on reporting and documentation processes to \\nimprove AI systems resource performance, such as reduction of energy and other resources \\nconsumption of the high-risk AI system during its lifecycle, and on energy efficient \\ndevelopment of general-purpose AI models. When preparing standardisation request, the \\nCommission shall consult the Board and relevant stakeholders, including the Advisory \\nForum.  \\nWhen issuing a standardisation request to European standardisation organisations, the \\nCommission shall specify that standards have to be consistent, including with the existing \\nand future standards developed in the various sectors for products covered by the existing \\nUnion safety legislation listed in Annex II, clear and aimed at ensuring that AI systems or \\nmodels placed on the market or put into service in the Union meet the relevant \\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation. \\nThe Commission shall request the European standardisation organisations to provide       \\nevidence of their best efforts to fulfil the above objectives in accordance with Article 24 of \\nRegulation EU 1025/2012. \\n1c \\nThe actors involved in the standardisation process shall seek to promote investment and \\ninnovation in AI, including through increasing legal certainty, as well as competitiveness \\nand growth of the Union market, and contribute to strengthening global cooperation on \\nstandardisation and taking into account existing international standards in the field of AI \\nthat are consistent with Union values, fundamental rights and interests, and enhance multi-\\nstakeholder governance ensuring a balanced representation of interests and effective \\nparticipation of all relevant stakeholders in accordance with Articles 5, 6, and 7 of \\nRegulation (EU) No 1025/2012 \\nArticle 41 \\nCommon specifications \\n1. \\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt, after consulting the Advisory Forum referred to \\nin Article 58a, implementing acts in accordance with the examination procedure referred to \\nin Article 74(2) establishing common specifications for the requirements set out in Chapter \\n2 of this Title or, as applicable, with requirements set out in Article [GPAI Chapter], for AI \\nsystems within the scope of this Regulation, where the following conditions have been \\nfulfilled: \\n(a) \\nthe Commission has requested, pursuant to Article 10(1) of Regulation 1025/2012, \\none or more European standardisation organisations to draft a harmonised standard \\nfor the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title; and  \\n(i) the request has not been accepted by any of the European standardisation \\norganisations; or  \\n(ii) the harmonised standards addressing that request are not delivered within the \\ndeadline set in accordance with article 10(1) of Regulation 1025/2012; or   \\n(iii) the relevant harmonised standards insufficiently address fundamental rights \\nconcerns; or  \\n(iv) the harmonised standards do not comply with the request; and \\n(b)  no reference to harmonised standards covering the requirements referred to in \\nChapter II of this Title has been published in the Official Journal of the European \\nUnion, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, and no such reference is \\nexpected to be published within a reasonable period. \\n1a. \\nBefore preparing a draft implementing act, the Commission shall inform the committee \\nreferred to in Article 22 of Regulation EU (No) 1025/2012 that it considers that the \\nconditions in paragraph 1 are fulfilled. \\n3. \\nHigh-risk AI systems which are in conformity with the common specifications referred to \\nin paragraph 1, or parts thereof, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the \\nrequirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, to the extent those common specifications \\ncover those requirements. \\n3a. \\nWhere a harmonised standard is adopted by a European standardisation organisation and \\nproposed to the Commission for the publication of its reference in the Official Journal of \\nthe European Union, the Commission shall assess the harmonised standard in accordance \\nwith Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. When reference of a harmonised standard is \\npublished in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission shall repeal acts \\nreferred to in paragraph 1 and 1b, or parts thereof which cover the same requirements set \\nout in Chapter 2 of this Title. \\n4. \\nWhere providers of high-risk AI systems do not comply with the common specifications \\nreferred to in paragraph 1, they shall duly justify that they have adopted technical solutions \\nthat meet the requirements referred to in Chapter II to a level at least equivalent thereto. \\n4b. \\nWhen a Member State considers that a common specification does not entirely satisfy the \\nrequirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, it shall inform the Commission thereof with \\na detailed explanation and the Commission shall assess that information and, if \\nappropriate, amend the implementing act establishing the common specification in \\nquestion. \\nArticle 42 \\nPresumption of conformity with certain requirements \\n1. \\nHigh-risk AI systems that have been trained and tested on data reflecting the specific \\ngeographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within which they are intended \\nto be used shall be presumed to be in compliance with the respective requirements set out \\nin Article 10(4). \\n2. \\nHigh-risk AI systems that have been certified or for which a statement of conformity has \\nbeen issued under a cybersecurity scheme pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the \\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council1 and the references of which have been published \\nin the Official Journal of the European Union shall be presumed to be in compliance with \\nthe cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 15 of this Regulation in so far as the \\ncybersecurity certificate or statement of conformity or parts thereof cover those \\nrequirements. \\nArticle 43 \\nConformity assessment \\n1. \\nFor high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III, where, in demonstrating the \\ncompliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this \\nTitle, the provider has applied harmonised standards referred to in Article 40, or, where \\napplicable, common specifications referred to in Article 41, the provider shall opt for one \\nof the following procedures: \\n(a) \\nthe conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex \\nVI; or \\n(b) \\nthe conformity assessment procedure based on assessment of the quality \\nmanagement system and assessment of the technical documentation, with the \\ninvolvement of a notified body, referred to in Annex VII. \\nIn demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in \\nChapter 2 of this Title, the provider shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set \\nout in Annex VII in the following cases:  \\n(a)   where harmonised standards referred to in Article 40, do not exist and common \\nspecifications referred to in Article 41 are not available;  \\n(aa) the provider has not applied or has applied only in part the harmonised standard;  \\n(b)   where the common specifications referred to in point (a) exist but the provider has \\nnot applied them;  \\n(c)   where one or more of the harmonised standards referred to in point (a) has been \\npublished with a restriction and only on the part of the standard that was restricted. \\nFor the purpose of the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII, the \\nprovider may choose any of the notified bodies. However, when the system is intended to \\nbe put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities as well as EU \\ninstitutions, bodies or agencies, the market surveillance authority referred to in Article \\n63(5) or (6), as applicable, shall act as a notified body. \\n2. \\nFor high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III providers shall follow the \\nconformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in Annex VI, \\nwhich does not provide for the involvement of a notified body. \\n3. \\nFor high-risk AI systems, to which legal acts listed in Annex II, section A, apply, the \\nprovider shall follow the relevant conformity assessment as required under those legal acts. \\nThe requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title shall apply to those high-risk AI systems \\nand shall be part of that assessment. Points 4.3., 4.4., 4.5. and the fifth paragraph of point \\n4.6 of Annex VII shall also apply. \\nFor the purpose of that assessment, notified bodies which have been notified under those \\nlegal acts shall be entitled to control the conformity of the high-risk AI systems with the \\nrequirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, provided that the compliance of those \\nnotified bodies with requirements laid down in Article 33(4), (9) and (10) has been \\nassessed in the context of the notification procedure under those legal acts. \\nWhere the legal acts listed in Annex II, section A, enable the manufacturer of the product \\nto opt out from a third-party conformity assessment, provided that that manufacturer has \\napplied all harmonised standards covering all the relevant requirements, that manufacturer \\nmay make use of that option only if he has also applied harmonised standards or, where \\napplicable, common specifications referred to in Article 41, covering the requirements set \\nout in Chapter 2 of this Title. \\n4. \\nHigh-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment procedure \\nshall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure whenever they are substantially \\nmodified, regardless of whether the modified system is intended to be further distributed or \\ncontinues to be used by the current deployer. \\nFor high-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into \\nservice, changes to the high-risk AI system and its performance that have been pre-\\ndetermined by the provider at the moment of the initial conformity assessment and are part \\nof the information contained in the technical documentation referred to in point 2(f) of \\nAnnex IV, shall not constitute a substantial modification. \\n5. \\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 for \\nthe purpose of updating Annexes VI and Annex VII in light of technical progress.  \\n6. \\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend paragraphs 1 and 2 in \\norder to subject high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III to the \\nconformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII or parts thereof. The \\nCommission shall adopt such delegated acts taking into account the effectiveness of the \\nconformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex VI in \\npreventing or minimizing the risks to health and safety and protection of fundamental \\nrights posed by such systems as well as the availability of adequate capacities and \\nresources among notified bodies.  \\nArticle 44 \\nCertificates \\n1. \\nCertificates issued by notified bodies in accordance with Annex VII shall be drawn-up in a \\nlanguage which can be easily understood by the relevant authorities in the Member State in \\nwhich the notified body is established.  \\n2. \\nCertificates shall be valid for the period they indicate, which shall not exceed five years for \\nAI systems covered by Annex II and four years for AI systems covered by Annex III. On \\napplication by the provider, the validity of a certificate may be extended for further \\nperiods, each not exceeding five years for AI systems covered by Annex II and four years \\nfor AI systems covered by Annex III, based on a re-assessment in accordance with the \\napplicable conformity assessment procedures. Any supplement to a certificate shall remain \\nvalid as long as the certificate which it supplements is valid. \\n3. \\nWhere a notified body finds that an AI system no longer meets the requirements set out in \\nChapter 2 of this Title, it shall, taking account of the principle of proportionality, suspend \\nor withdraw the certificate issued or impose any restrictions on it, unless compliance with \\nthose requirements is ensured by appropriate corrective action taken by the provider of the \\nsystem within an appropriate deadline set by the notified body. The notified body shall \\ngive reasons for its decision. \\nAn appeal procedure against decisions of the notified bodies, including on issued \\nconformity certificates, shall be available. \\nArticle 46 \\nInformation obligations of notified bodies \\n1. \\nNotified bodies shall inform the notifying authority of the following:  \\n(a) \\nany Union technical documentation assessment certificates, any supplements to those \\ncertificates, quality management system approvals issued in accordance with the \\nrequirements of Annex VII; \\n(b) \\nany refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a Union technical \\ndocumentation assessment certificate or a quality management system approval \\nissued in accordance with the requirements of Annex VII;  \\n(c) \\nany circumstances affecting the scope of or conditions for notification; \\n(d) \\nany request for information which they have received from market surveillance \\nauthorities regarding conformity assessment activities; \\n(e) \\non request, conformity assessment activities performed within the scope of their \\nnotification and any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and \\nsubcontracting. \\n2. \\nEach notified body shall inform the other notified bodies of: \\n(a) \\nquality management system approvals which it has refused, suspended or withdrawn, \\nand, upon request, of quality system approvals which it has issued; \\n(b)  EU technical documentation assessment certificates or any supplements thereto \\nwhich it has refused, withdrawn, suspended or otherwise restricted, and, upon \\nrequest, of the certificates and/or supplements thereto which it has issued. \\n3. \\nEach notified body shall provide the other notified bodies carrying out similar conformity \\nassessment activities covering the same types of AI systems with relevant information on \\nissues relating to negative and, on request, positive conformity assessment results. \\n3a. \\nThe obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be complied with in accordance with \\nArticle 70. \\nArticle 47 \\nDerogation from conformity assessment procedure \\n1. \\nBy way of derogation from Article 43 and upon a duly justified request, any market \\nsurveillance authority may authorise the placing on the market or putting into service of \\nspecific high-risk AI systems within the territory of the Member State concerned, for \\nexceptional reasons of public security or the protection of life and health of persons, \\nenvironmental protection and the protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets. \\nThat authorisation shall be for a limited period of time while the necessary conformity \\nassessment procedures are being carried out, taking into account the exceptional reasons \\njustifying the derogation. The completion of those procedures shall be undertaken without \\nundue delay. \\n1a. \\nIn a duly justified situation of urgency for exceptional reasons of public security or in case \\nof specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons, \\nlaw enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a specific high-risk AI \\nsystem into service without the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 provided that such \\nauthorisation is requested during or after the use without undue delay, and if such \\nauthorisation is rejected, its use shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the results \\nand outputs of this use shall be immediately discarded.  \\n2. \\nThe authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance \\nauthority concludes that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of Chapter \\n2 of this Title. The market surveillance authority shall inform the Commission and the \\nother Member States of any authorisation issued pursuant to paragraph 1. This obligation \\nshall not cover sensitive operational data in relation to the activities of law enforcement \\nauthorities.  \\n3. \\nWhere, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 2, no \\nobjection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of an \\nauthorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of a Member State in accordance \\nwith paragraph 1, that authorisation shall be deemed justified. \\n4. \\nWhere, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, \\nobjections are raised by a Member State against an authorisation issued by a market \\nsurveillance authority of another Member State, or where the Commission considers the \\nauthorisation to be contrary to Union law or the conclusion of the Member States regarding \\nthe compliance of the system as referred to in paragraph 2 to be unfounded, the \\nCommission shall without delay enter into consultation with the relevant Member State; \\nthe operator(s) concerned shall be consulted and have the possibility to present their views. \\nIn view thereof, the Commission shall decide whether the authorisation is justified or not. \\nThe Commission shall address its decision to the Member State concerned and the relevant \\noperator or operators. \\n5. \\nIf the authorisation is considered unjustified, this shall be withdrawn by the market \\nsurveillance authority of the Member State concerned.  \\n6. \\nFor high-risk AI systems related to products covered by Union harmonisation legislation \\nreferred to in Annex II Section A, only the conformity assessment derogation procedures \\nestablished in that legislation shall apply. \\nArticle 48 \\nEU declaration of conformity \\n1. \\nThe provider shall draw up a written machine readable, physical or electronically signed \\nEU declaration of conformity for each high-risk AI system and keep it at the disposal of \\nthe national competent authorities for 10 years after the AI high-risk system has been \\nplaced on the market or put into service. The EU declaration of conformity shall identify \\nthe high-risk AI system for which it has been drawn up. A copy of the EU declaration of \\nconformity shall be submitted to the  relevant national competent authorities upon request. \\n2. \\nThe EU declaration of conformity shall state that the high-risk AI system in question meets \\nthe requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title. The EU declaration of conformity shall \\ncontain the information set out in Annex V and shall be translated into a language that can \\nbe easily understood by the national competent authorities of the Member State(s) in which \\nthe high-risk AI system is placed on the market or made available. \\n3. \\nWhere high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union harmonisation legislation which \\nalso requires an EU declaration of conformity, a single EU declaration of conformity shall \\nbe drawn up in respect of all Union legislations applicable to the high-risk AI system. The \\ndeclaration shall contain all the information required for identification of the Union \\nharmonisation legislation to which the declaration relates.  \\n4. \\nBy drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the provider shall assume responsibility \\nfor compliance with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title. The provider shall \\nkeep the EU declaration of conformity up-to-date as appropriate. \\n5. \\nThe Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 \\nfor the purpose of updating the content of the EU declaration of conformity set out in \\nAnnex V in order to introduce elements that become necessary in light of technical \\nprogress. \\nArticle 49 \\nCE marking of conformity \\n1. \\nThe CE marking of conformity shall be subject to the general principles set out in Article \\n30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. \\n1a. \\nFor  high-risk AI systems provided digitally, a digital CE marking shall be used, only if it \\ncan be easily accessed via the interface from which the AI system is accessed or via an \\neasily accessible machine-readable code or other electronic means. \\n2. \\nThe CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly for high-risk AI systems. \\nWhere that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the high-risk AI \\nsystem, it shall be affixed to the packaging or to the accompanying documentation, as \\nappropriate. \\n3. \\nWhere applicable, the CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the \\nnotified body responsible for the conformity assessment procedures set out in Article 43. \\nThe identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under \\nits instructions, by the provider or by its authorised representative. The identification \\nnumber shall also be indicated in any promotional material which mentions that the high-\\nrisk AI system fulfils the requirements for CE marking.  \\n3a. \\nWhere high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union law which also provides for the \\naffixing of the CE marking, the CE marking shall indicate that the high-risk AI system also \\nfulfil the requirements of that other law. \\nArticle 51 \\nRegistration \\n 1. \\nBefore placing on the market or putting into service a high-risk AI system listed in Annex \\nIII, with the exception of high risk AI systems referred to in Annex III point 2, the provider \\nor, where applicable, the authorised representative shall register themselves and their \\nsystem in the EU database referred to in Article 60.  \\n 1a.  \\nBefore placing on the market or putting into service an AI system for which the provider \\nhas concluded that it is not high-risk in application of the procedure under Article 6(2a), \\nthe provider or, where applicable, the authorised representative shall register themselves \\nand that system in the EU database referred to in Article 60. \\n 1b.  \\nBefore putting into service or using a high-risk AI system listed in Annex III, with the \\nexception of high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III, point 2, deployers who are public \\nauthorities, agencies or bodies or persons acting on their behalf shall register themselves, \\nselect the system and register its use in the EU database referred to in Article 60.  \\n 1c.  \\nFor high-risk AI systems referred to Annex III, points 1, 6 and 7 in the areas of law \\nenforcement, migration, asylum and border control management, the registration referred \\nto in paragraphs 1 to 1b shall be done in a secure non-public section of the EU database \\nreferred to in Article 60 and include only the following information, as applicable: \\n-  points 1 to 9 of Annex VIII, section A with the exception of points 5a, 7 and 8;                              \\n-  points 1 to 3 of Annex VIII, section B;                                                                                              \\n-  points 1 to 9 of Annex VIII, section X with the exception of points 6 and 7;                                              \\n-  points 1 to 5 of Annex VIIIa with the exception of point 4. \\nOnly the Commission and national authorities referred to in Art. 63(5) shall have access to \\nthese restricted sections of the EU database.  \\n1d.  \\nHigh risk AI systems referred to in Annex III, point 2 shall be registered at national level. \\nTITLE IV \\nTRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDERS AND \\nDEPLOYERS OF CERTAIN AI SYSTEMS  \\nArticle 52 \\nTransparency obligations for providers and users of certain AI systems and GPAI models \\n1. \\nProviders shall ensure that AI systems intended to directly interact with natural persons are \\ndesigned and developed in such a way that the concerned natural persons are informed that \\nthey are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a \\nnatural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect, taking into \\naccount the circumstances and the context of use. This obligation shall not apply to AI \\nsystems authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offences, \\nsubject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties unless those \\nsystems are available for the public to report a criminal offence. \\n1a.  \\nProviders of AI systems, including GPAI systems, generating synthetic audio, image, \\nvideo or text content, shall ensure the outputs of the AI system are marked in a machine-\\nreadable format and detectable as artificially generated or manipulated. Providers shall \\nensure their technical solutions are effective, interoperable, robust and reliable as far as this \\nis technically feasible, taking into account specificities and limitations of different types of \\ncontent, costs of implementation and the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art, as may \\nbe reflected in relevant technical standards. This obligation shall not apply to the extent the \\nAI systems perform an assistive function for standard editing or do not substantially alter \\nthe input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof, or where authorised by \\nlaw to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offences.  \\n2. \\nDeployers of an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorisation system shall \\ninform of the operation of the system the natural persons exposed thereto and process the \\npersonal data in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2016/1725 \\nand Directive (EU) 2016/280, as applicable. This obligation shall not apply to AI systems \\nused for biometric categorization and emotion recognition, which are permitted by law to \\ndetect, prevent and investigate criminal offences, subject to appropriate safeguards for the \\nrights and freedoms of third parties, and in compliance with Union law. \\n3. \\nDeployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates image, audio or video content \\nconstituting a deep fake, shall disclose that the content has been artificially generated or \\nmanipulated.  This obligation shall not apply where the use is authorised by law to detect, \\nprevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offence. Where the content forms part of an \\nevidently artistic, creative, satirical, fictional analogous work or programme, the \\ntransparency obligations set out in this paragraph are limited to disclosure of the existence \\nof such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does not hamper \\nthe display or enjoyment of the work.  \\nDeployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates text which is published with the \\npurpose of informing the public on matters of public interest shall disclose that the text has \\nbeen artificially generated or manipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the use is \\nauthorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal offences or where \\nthe AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial control and \\nwhere a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the publication of the \\ncontent. \\n3a. \\nThe information referred to in paragraphs 1 to 3 shall be provided to the concerned natural \\npersons in a clear and distinguishable manner at the latest at the time of the first interaction \\nor exposure. The information shall respect the applicable accessibility requirements. \\n4. \\nParagraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not affect the requirements and obligations set out in Title III of \\nthis Regulation and shall be without prejudice to other transparency obligations for users of \\nAI systems laid down in Union or national law. \\n4a.  \\nThe AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union \\nlevel to facilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the detection \\nand labelling of artificially generated or manipulated content. The Commission is \\nempowered to adopt implementing acts to approve these codes of practice in accordance \\nwith the procedure laid down in Article 52e paragraphs 6-8. If it deems the code is not \\nadequate, the Commission is empowered to adopt an implementing act specifying the \\ncommon rules for the implementation of those obligations in accordance with the \\nexamination procedure laid down in Article 73 paragraph 2. \\nTITLE VIIIA  \\nGENERAL PURPOSE AI MODELS \\nChapter 1  \\nCLASSIFICATION RULES \\nArticle 52a  \\nClassification of general purpose AI models as general purpose AI models with systemic risk \\n1. \\nA general purpose AI model shall be classified as general-purpose AI model with systemic \\nrisk if it meets any of the following criteria: \\n(a) \\nit has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools \\nand methodologies, including indicators and benchmarks; \\n(b)  based on a decision of the Commission, ex officio or following a qualified alert by \\nthe scientific panel that a general purpose AI model has capabilities or impact \\nequivalent to those of point (a). \\n2. \\nA general purpose AI model shall be presumed to have high impact capabilities pursuant to \\npoint a) of paragraph 1 when the cumulative amount of compute used for its training \\nmeasured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is greater than 10^25. \\n3. \\nThe Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73(2) to amend the \\nthresholds listed in the paragraphs above, as well as to supplement benchmarks and \\nindicators in light of evolving technological developments, such as algorithmic \\nimprovements or increased hardware efficiency, when necessary, for these thresholds to \\nreflect the state of the art.  \\nArticle 52b \\nProcedure \\n1. \\nWhere a general purpose AI model meets the requirements referred to in points (a) of \\nArticle 52a(1), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any \\nevent within 2 weeks after those requirements are met or it becomes known that these \\nrequirements will be met. That notification shall include the information necessary to \\ndemonstrate that the relevant requirements have been met. If the Commission becomes \\naware of a general purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been \\nnotified, it may decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk. \\n2. \\nThe provider of a general purpose AI model that meets the requirements referred to in \\npoints (a) of Article 52a(1) may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated \\narguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets the said requirements, the \\ngeneral-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic \\nrisks and therefore should not be classified as general-purpose AI model with systemic \\nrisk. \\n3. \\nWhere the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 \\nare not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate that \\nthe general purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic \\nrisks, it shall reject those arguments and the general purpose AI model shall be considered \\nas general purpose AI model with systemic risk. \\n4. \\nThe Commission may designate a general purpose AI model as presenting systemic risks, \\nex officio or following a qualified alert of the scientific panel pursuant to point (a) of \\nArticle 68h [Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel] (1) on the basis of criteria set \\nout in Annex IXc. The Commission shall be empowered to specify and update the criteria \\nin Annex IXc by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 74(2). \\n4a.  \\nUpon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general \\npurpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take \\nthe request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general purpose AI model \\ncan still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex \\nIXc. Such request shall contain objective, concrete and new reasons that have arisen since \\nthe designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months \\nafter the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its reassessment, decides \\nto maintain the designation as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, providers may \\nrequest reassessment at the earliest six months after this decision. \\n5. \\nThe Commission shall ensure that a list of general purpose AI models with systemic risk is \\npublished and shall keep that list up to date, without prejudice to the need to respect and \\nprotect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in \\naccordance with Union and national law. \\nOBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDERS OF GENERAL PURPOSE AI \\nChapter 2 \\nMODELS \\nArticle 52c \\nObligations for providers of general purpose AI models \\n1. \\nProviders of general purpose AI models shall: \\n(a) \\ndraw up and keep up-to-date the technical documentation of the model, including its \\ntraining and testing process and the results of its evaluation, which shall contain, at a \\nminimum, the elements set out in Annex IXa for the purpose of providing it, upon \\nrequest, to the AI Office and the national competent authorities;  \\n(b)  draw up, keep up-to-date and make available information and documentation to \\nproviders of AI systems who intend to integrate the general purpose AI model in \\ntheir AI system. Without prejudice to the need to respect and protect intellectual \\nproperty rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in accordance \\nwith Union and national law, the information and documentation shall: \\n(i) \\nenable providers of AI systems to have a good understanding of the capabilities \\nand limitations of the general purpose AI model and to comply with their \\nobligations pursuant to this Regulation; and \\n(ii) \\ncontain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex IXb. \\n(c) \\nput in place a policy to respect Union copyright law in particular to identify and \\nrespect, including through state of the art technologies, the reservations of rights \\nexpressed pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790; \\n(d)  draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the \\ncontent used for training of the general-purpose AI model, according to a template \\nprovided by the AI Office. \\n -2.  \\nThe obligations set out in paragraph 1, with the exception of letters (c) and (d), shall not \\napply to providers of AI models that are made accessible to the public under a free and \\nopen licence that allows for the access, usage, modification, and distribution of the model, \\nand whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, \\nand the information on model usage, are made publicly available. This exception shall not \\napply to general purpose AI models with systemic risks.  \\n2.  \\nProviders of general purpose AI models shall cooperate as necessary with the Commission \\nand the national competent authorities in the exercise of their competences and powers \\npursuant to this Regulation. \\n3. \\nProviders of general purpose AI models may rely on codes of practice within the meaning \\nof Article 52e demonstrate compliance with the obligations in paragraph 1, until a \\nharmonised standard is published. Compliance with a European harmonised standard \\ngrants providers the presumption of conformity. Providers of general purpose AI models \\nwith systemic risks who do not adhere to an approved code of practice shall demonstrate \\nalternative adequate means of compliance for approval of the Commission. \\n4. \\nFor the purpose of facilitating compliance with Annex IXa, notably point 2, (d) and (e), the \\nCommission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to \\ndetail measurement and calculation methodologies with a view to allow comparable and \\nverifiable documentation. \\n4a.  \\nThe Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73(2) to \\namend Annexes IXa and IXb in the light of the evolving technological developments. \\n4b.  \\nAny information and documentation obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Article, \\nincluding trade secrets, shall be treated in compliance with the confidentiality obligations \\nset out in Article 70. \\nArticle 52ca \\nAuthorised representative \\n1.  \\nPrior to placing a general purpose AI model on the Union market providers established \\noutside the Union shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative which is \\nestablished in the Union and shall enable it to perform its tasks under this Regulation. \\n2.  \\nThe authorised representative shall perform the tasks specified in the mandate received \\nfrom the provider. It shall provide a copy of the mandate to the AI Office upon request, in \\none of the official languages of the institutions of the Union. For the purpose of this \\nRegulation, the mandate shall empower the authorised representative to carry out the \\nfollowing tasks: \\n(a)     \\nverify that the technical documentation specified in Annex IXa has been drawn up \\nand all obligations referred to in Articles 52c and, where applicable, Article 52d \\nhave been fulfilled by the provider; \\n(b)    \\n keep a copy of the technical documentation at the disposal of the AI Office and \\nnational competent authorities, for a period ending 10 years after the model has \\nbeen  placed on the market and the contact details of the provider by which the \\nauthorised  representative has been appointed; \\n(c)     \\nprovide the AI Office, upon a reasoned request, with all the information and  \\ndocumentation, including that kept according to point (a), necessary to  \\ndemonstrate the compliance with the obligations in this Title; \\n(d)     \\ncooperate with the AI Office and national competent authorities, upon a reasoned \\nrequest, on any action the latter takes in relation to the general purpose AI model \\nwith systemic risks, including when the model is integrated into AI systems  \\nplaced on the market or put into service in the Union. \\n3.  \\nThe mandate shall empower the authorised representative to be addressed, in addition to or \\ninstead of the provider, by the AI Office or the national competent authorities, on all issues \\nrelated to ensuring compliance with this Regulation.  \\n4.  \\nThe authorised representative shall terminate the mandate if it considers or has reason to \\nconsider that the provider acts contrary to its obligations under this Regulation. In such a \\ncase, it shall also immediately inform the AI Office about the termination of the mandate \\nand the reasons thereof. \\n5.  \\nThe obligation set out in this article shall not apply to providers of general purpose AI \\nmodels that are made accessible to the public under a free and open source licence that \\nallows for the access, usage, modification, and distribution of the model, and whose \\nparameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the \\ninformation on model usage, are made publicly available, unless the general purpose AI \\nmodels present systemic risks. \\nChapter 3 \\nOBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDERS OF GENERAL PURPOSE AI \\nMODELS WITH SYSTEMIC RISK \\nArticle 52d \\nObligations for providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risk \\n1. \\nIn addition to the obligations listed in Article 52c, providers of general purpose AI models \\nwith systemic risk shall: \\n(a) \\nperform model evaluation in accordance with standardised protocols and tools \\nreflecting the state of the art, including conducting and documenting adversarial \\ntesting of the model with a view to identify and mitigate systemic risk; \\n(b) \\nassess and mitigate possible systemic risks at Union level, including their sources, \\nthat may stem from the development, placing on the market, or use of general \\npurpose AI models with systemic risk; \\n(c) \\nkeep track of, document and report without undue delay to the AI Office and, as \\nappropriate, to national competent authorities, relevant information about serious \\nincidents and possible corrective measures to address them; \\n(d) \\nensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the general purpose AI \\nmodel with systemic risk and the physical infrastructure of the model. \\n2. \\nProviders of general purpose AI models with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice \\nwithin the meaning of Article E to demonstrate compliance with the obligations in \\nparagraph 1, until a harmonised standard is published. Compliance with a European \\nharmonised standard grants providers the presumption of conformity. Providers of general-\\npurpose AI models with systemic risks who do not adhere to an approved code of practice \\nshall demonstrate alternative adequate means of compliance for approval of the \\nCommission. \\n3. \\nAny information and documentation obtained pursuant to the provisions of this Article, \\nincluding trade secrets, shall be treated in compliance with the confidentiality obligations \\nset out in Article 70. \\nArticle 52e \\nCodes of practice \\n1. \\nThe AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union \\nlevel as an element to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking into \\naccount international approaches. \\n2. \\nThe AI Office and the AI Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice cover, but \\nnot necessarily be limited to, the obligations provided for in Articles 52c and 52d, \\nincluding the following issues: \\n(a)  means to ensure that the information referred to in Article 52c (a) and (b) is kept up \\nto date in the light of market and technological developments, and the adequate level \\nof detail for the summary about the content used for training; \\n(b) \\nthe identification of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, \\nincluding their sources when appropriate; \\n(c) \\nthe measures, procedures and modalities for the assessment and management of the \\nsystemic risks at Union level, including the documentation thereof. The assessment \\nand management of the systemic risks at Union level shall be proportionate to the \\nrisks, take into consideration their severity and probability and take into account the \\nspecific challenges of tackling those risks in the light of the possible ways in which \\nsuch risks may emerge and materialize along the AI value chain. \\n3. \\nThe AI Office may invite the providers of general purpose AI models, as well as relevant \\nnational competent authorities, to participate in the drawing up of codes of practice. Civil \\nsociety organisations, industry, academia and other relevant stakeholders, such as \\ndownstream providers and independent experts, may support the process.  \\n4. \\nThe AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice clearly set out \\ntheir specific objectives and contain commitments or measures, including key performance \\nindicators as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of those objectives and take due \\naccount of the needs and interests of all interested parties, including affected persons, at \\nUnion level. \\n5. \\nThe AI Office may invite all providers of general purpose AI models to participate in the \\ncodes of practice. For providers of general purpose AI models not presenting systemic \\nrisks this participation should be limited to obligations foreseen in paragraph 2 point (a) of \\nthis Article, unless they declare explicitly their interest to join the full code. \\n6. \\nThe AI Office shall aim to ensure that participants to the codes of practice report regularly \\nto the AI Office on the implementation of the commitments and the measures taken and \\ntheir outcomes, including as measured against the key performance indicators as \\nappropriate. Key performance indicators and reporting commitments shall take into \\naccount differences in size and capacity between different participants. \\n7. \\nThe AI Office and the AI Board shall regularly monitor and evaluate the achievement of \\nthe objectives of the codes of practice by the participants and their contribution to the \\nproper application of this Regulation. The AI Office and the Board shall assess whether the \\ncodes of practice cover the obligations provided for in Articles 52c and 52d, including the \\nissues listed in paragraph 2 of this Article, and shall regularly monitor and evaluate the \\nachievement of their objectives. They shall publish their assessment of the adequacy of the \\ncodes of practice. The Commission may, by way of implementing acts, decide to approve \\nthe code of practice and give it a general validity within the Union. Those implementing \\nacts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article \\n74(2). \\n8. \\nAs appropriate, the AI Office shall also encourage and facilitate review and adaptation of \\nthe codes of practice, in particular in light of emerging standards. The AI Office shall assist \\nin the assessment of available standards. \\n9. \\nIf, by the time the Regulation becomes applicable, a Code of Practice cannot be finalised, \\nor if the AI Office deems it is not adequate following under paragraph 7, the Commission \\nmay provide, by means of implementing acts, common rules for the implementation of the \\nobligations provided for in Articles 52c and 52d, including the issues set out in paragraph \\n2. \\nTITLE V \\nMEASURES IN SUPPORT OF INNOVATION \\nArticle 53 \\nAI regulatory sandboxes  \\n1. \\nMember States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI \\nregulatory sandbox at national level, which shall be operational 24 months after entry into \\nforce. This sandbox may also be established jointly with one or several other Member \\nStates’ competent authorities. The Commission may provide technical support, advice and \\ntools for the establishment and operation of AI regulatory sandboxes. \\nThe obligation established in previous paragraph can also be fulfilled by participation in an \\nexisting sandbox insofar as this participation provides equivalent level of national coverage \\nfor the participating Member States. \\n1a. \\nAdditional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local levels or jointly with other \\nMember States\\' competent authorities may also be established. \\n1b. \\nThe European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI regulatory sandbox for \\nthe EU institutions, bodies and agencies and exercise the roles and the tasks of national \\ncompetent authorities in accordance with this chapter. \\n1c. \\nMember States shall ensure that competent authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 1a \\nallocate sufficient resources to comply with this Article effectively and in a timely manner. \\nWhere appropriate, national competent authorities shall cooperate with other relevant \\nauthorities and may allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem. \\nThis Article shall not affect other regulatory sandboxes established under national or Union \\nlaw. Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation between the \\nauthorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent authorities.  \\n1d. \\n AI regulatory sandboxes established under Article 53(1) of this Regulation shall, in \\naccordance with Articles 53 and 53a, provide for a controlled environment that fosters \\ninnovation and facilitates the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI \\nsystems for a limited time before their placement on the market or putting into service \\npursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the prospective providers and the \\ncompetent authority. Such regulatory sandboxes may include testing in real world \\nconditions supervised in the sandbox.  \\n1e. \\nCompetent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision and support \\nwithin the sandbox with a view to identifying risks, in particular to fundamental rights, \\nhealth and safety, testing, mitigation measures, and their effectiveness in relation to the \\nobligations and requirements of this Regulation and, where relevant, other Union and \\nMember States legislation supervised within the sandbox.  \\n1f. \\nCompetent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers with guidance on \\nregulatory expectations and how to fulfil the requirements and obligations set out in this \\nRegulation. \\nUpon request of the provider or prospective provider of the AI system, the competent \\nauthority shall provide a written proof of the activities successfully carried out in the \\nsandbox. The competent authority shall also provide an exit report detailing the activities \\ncarried out in the sandbox and the related results and learning outcomes. Providers may use \\nsuch documentation to demonstrate the compliance with this Regulation through the \\nconformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities. In this regard, the \\nexit reports and the written proof provided by the national competent authority shall be \\ntaken positively into account by market surveillance authorities and notified bodies, with a \\nview to accelerate conformity assessment procedures to a reasonable extent. \\n1fa.  \\nSubject to the confidentiality provisions in Article 70 and with the agreement of the \\nsandbox provider/prospective provider, the European Commission and the Board shall be \\nauthorised to access the exit reports and shall take them into account, as appropriate, when \\nexercising their tasks under this Regulation. If both provider and prospective provider and \\nthe national competent authority explicitly agree to this, the exit report can be made \\npublicly available through the single information platform referred to in this article. \\n1g. \\nThe establishment of AI regulatory sandboxes shall aim to contribute to the following \\nobjectives: \\n(a)  \\nimprove legal certainty to achieve regulatory compliance with this Regulation or, \\nwhere relevant, other applicable Union and Member States legislation; \\n(b)  \\nsupport the sharing of best practices through cooperation with the authorities  \\ninvolved in the AI regulatory sandbox; \\n(c)  \\nfoster innovation and competitiveness and facilitate the development of an AI \\n(d)  \\n(e)  \\necosystem; \\ncontribute to evidence-based regulatory learning;  \\nfacilitate and accelerate access to the Union market for AI systems, in particular \\nwhen provided by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including start-\\nups.  \\n2. \\nNational competent authorities shall ensure that, to the extent the innovative AI systems \\ninvolve the processing of personal data or otherwise fall under the supervisory remit of \\nother national authorities or competent authorities providing or supporting access to data, \\nthe national data protection authorities, and those other national authorities are associated \\nto the operation of the AI regulatory sandbox and involved in the supervision of those \\naspects to the extent of their respective tasks and powers, as applicable. \\n3. \\nThe AI regulatory sandboxes shall not affect the supervisory and corrective powers of the \\ncompetent authorities supervising the sandboxes, including at regional or local level. Any \\nsignificant risks to health and safety and fundamental rights identified during the \\ndevelopment and testing of such AI systems shall result in an adequate mitigation. National \\ncompetent authorities shall have the power to temporarily or permanently suspend the \\ntesting process, or participation in the sandbox if no effective mitigation is possible and \\ninform the AI Office of such decision. National competent authorities shall exercise their \\nsupervisory powers within the limits of the relevant legislation, using their discretionary \\npowers when implementing legal provisions to a specific AI sandbox project, with the \\nobjective of supporting innovation in AI in the Union.  \\n4. \\nProviders and prospective providers in the AI regulatory sandbox shall remain liable under \\napplicable Union and Member States liability legislation for any damage inflicted on third \\nparties as a result of the experimentation taking place in the sandbox. However, provided \\nthat the prospective provider(s) respect the specific plan and the terms and conditions for \\ntheir participation and follow in good faith the guidance given by the national competent \\nauthority, no administrative fines shall be imposed by the authorities for infringements of \\nthis Regulation. To the extent that other competent authorities responsible for other Union \\nand Member States’ legislation have been actively involved in the supervision of the AI \\nsystem in the sandbox and have provided guidance for compliance, no administrative fines \\nshall be imposed regarding that legislation. \\n4b.  \\nThe AI regulatory sandboxes shall be designed and implemented in such a way that, where \\nrelevant, they facilitate cross-border cooperation between national competent authorities.  \\n5. \\nNational competent authorities shall coordinate their activities and cooperate within the \\nframework of the Board. \\n5a. \\nNational competent authorities shall inform the AI Office and the Board of the \\nestablishment of a sandbox and may ask for support and guidance. A list of planned and \\nexisting AI sandboxes shall be made publicly available by the AI Office and kept up to \\ndate in order to encourage more interaction in the regulatory sandboxes and cross-border \\ncooperation.  \\n5b. \\nNational competent authorities shall submit to the AI Office and to the Board, annual \\nreports, starting one year after the establishment of the AI regulatory sandbox and then \\nevery year until its termination and a final report. Those reports shall provide information \\non the progress and results of the implementation of those sandboxes, including best \\npractices, incidents, lessons learnt and recommendations on their setup and, where \\nrelevant, on the application and possible revision of this Regulation, including its delegated \\nand implementing acts, and other Union law supervised within the sandbox. Those annual \\nreports or abstracts thereof shall be made available to the public, online. The Commission \\nshall, where appropriate, take the annual reports into account when exercising their tasks \\nunder this Regulation. \\n6. \\nThe Commission shall develop a single and dedicated interface containing all relevant \\ninformation related to sandboxes to allow stakeholders to interact with regulatory \\nsandboxes and to raise enquiries with competent authorities, and to seek non-binding \\nguidance on the conformity of innovative products, services, business models embedding \\nAI technologies, in accordance with Article 55(1)(c).

Where relevant, post-market monitoring \\nshall include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems. This obligation shall not \\ncover sensitive operational data of deployers which are law enforcement authorities. \\n3. \\nThe post-market monitoring system shall be based on a post-market monitoring plan. The \\npost-market monitoring plan shall be part of the technical documentation referred to in \\nAnnex IV. The Commission shall adopt an implementing act laying down detailed \\nprovisions establishing a template for the post-market monitoring plan and the list of \\nelements to be included in the plan by six months before the entry into application of this \\nRegulation. \\n4. \\nFor high-risk AI systems covered by the legal acts referred to in Annex II, Section A, \\nwhere a post-market monitoring system and plan is already established under that \\nlegislation, in order to ensure consistency, avoid duplications and minimise additional \\nburdens, providers shall have a choice to integrate, as appropriate, the necessary elements \\ndescribed in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 using the template referred in paragraph 3 into already \\nexisting system and plan under the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, \\nSection A, provided it achieves an equivalent level of protection. \\nThe first subparagraph shall also apply high-risk AI systems referred to in point 5 of \\nAnnex III placed on the market or put into service by financial institutions that are subject \\nto requirements regarding their internal governance, arrangements or processes under \\nUnion financial services legislation.  \\nSHARING OF INFORMATION ON SERIOUS INCIDENTS \\nChapter 2 \\nArticle 62 \\nReporting of serious incidents  \\n1. \\nProviders of high-risk AI systems placed on the Union market shall report any serious \\nincident to the market surveillance authorities of the Member States where that incident \\noccurred. \\n1a.  \\nAs a general rule, the period for the reporting referred to in paragraph 1 shall take account \\nof the severity of the serious incident. \\n1b.  \\nThe notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made immediately after the provider \\nhas established a causal link between the AI system and the serious incident or the \\nreasonable likelihood of such a link, and, in any event, not later than 15 days after the \\nprovider or, where applicable, the deployer, becomes aware of the serious incident.  \\n1c.  \\nNotwithstanding paragraph 1b, in the event of a widespread infringement or a serious \\nincident as defined in Article 3(44) point (b) the report referred to in paragraph 1 shall be \\nprovided immediately, and not later than 2 days after the provider or, where applicable, the \\ndeployer becomes aware of that incident. \\n1d.  \\nNotwithstanding paragraph 1b, in the event of death of a person the report shall be \\nprovided immediately after the provider or the deployer has established or as soon as it \\nsuspects a causal relationship between the high-risk AI system and the serious incident but \\nnot later than 10 days after the date on which the provider or, where applicable, the \\ndeployer becomes aware of the serious incident. \\n1e.   Where necessary to ensure timely reporting, the provider or, where applicable, the \\ndeployer, may submit an initial report that is incomplete followed up by a complete report. \\n1a. \\nFollowing the reporting of a serious incident pursuant to the first subparagraph, the \\nprovider shall, without delay, perform the necessary investigations in relation to the serious \\nincident and the AI system concerned. This shall include a risk assessment of the incident \\nand corrective action. The provider shall co-operate with the competent authorities and \\nwhere relevant with the notified body concerned during the investigations referred to in the \\nfirst subparagraph and shall not perform any investigation which involves altering the AI \\nsystem concerned in a way which may affect any subsequent evaluation of the causes of \\nthe incident, prior to informing the competent authorities of such action. \\n2. \\nUpon receiving a notification related to a serious incident referred to in Article 3(44)(c), \\nthe relevant market surveillance authority shall inform the national public authorities or \\nbodies referred to in Article 64(3). The Commission shall develop dedicated guidance to \\nfacilitate compliance with the obligations set out in paragraph 1. That guidance shall be \\nissued 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation, at the latest, and shall be \\nassessed regularly. \\n2a. \\nThe market surveillance authority shall take appropriate measures, as provided in Article \\n19 of the Regulation 2019/1020, within 7 days from the date it received the notification \\nreferred to in paragraph 1 and follow the notification procedures as provided in the \\nRegulation 2019/1020. \\n3. \\nFor high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III that are placed on the market or put into \\nservice by providers that are subject to Union legislative instruments laying down reporting \\nobligations equivalent to those set out in this Regulation, the notification of serious \\nincidents  shall be limited to those referred to in Article 3(44)(c).  \\n3a. \\nFor high-risk AI systems which are safety components of devices, or are themselves \\ndevices, covered by Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 the \\nnotification of serious incidents shall be limited to those referred to in Article 3(44)(c) and \\nbe made to the national competent authority chosen for this purpose by the Member States \\nwhere that incident occurred. \\n3a. \\nNational competent authorities shall immediately notify the Commission of any serious \\nincident, whether or not it has taken action on it, in accordance with Article 20 of \\nRegulation 2019/1020. \\nChapter 3 \\nENFORCEMENT  \\nArticle 63 \\nMarket surveillance and control of AI systems in the Union market \\n1. \\nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to AI systems covered by this Regulation. \\nHowever, for the purpose of the effective enforcement of this Regulation: \\n(a) \\nany reference to an economic operator under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall be \\nunderstood as including all operators identified in Article 2(1) of this Regulation; \\n(b) \\nany reference to a product under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall be understood as \\nincluding all AI systems falling within the scope of this Regulation. \\n2. \\nAs part of their reporting obligations under Article 34(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, \\nthe market surveillance authorities shall report annually, to the Commission and relevant \\nnational competition authorities any information identified in the course of market \\nsurveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the application of Union law on \\ncompetition rules.  They shall also annually report to the Commission about the use of \\nprohibited practices that occurred during that year and about the measures taken.  \\n3. \\nFor high-risk AI systems, related to products to which legal acts listed in Annex II, section \\nA apply, the market surveillance authority for the purposes of this Regulation shall be the \\nauthority responsible for market surveillance activities designated under those legal acts. \\nBy derogation from the previous paragraph in justified circumstances, Member States may \\ndesignate another relevant authority to act as a market surveillance authority provided that \\ncoordination is ensured with the relevant sectoral market surveillance authorities \\nresponsible for the enforcement of the legal acts listed in Annex II. \\n3a. \\nThe procedures referred to in Articles 65, 66, 67 and 68 of this Regulation shall not apply \\nto AI systems related to products, to which legal acts listed in Annex II, section A apply, \\nwhen such legal acts already provide for procedures ensuring an equivalent level of \\nprotection and having the same objective. In such a case, these sectoral procedures shall \\napply instead. \\n3b. \\nWithout prejudice to the powers of market surveillance authorities under Article 14 of \\nRegulation 2019/1020, for the purpose of ensuring the effective enforcement of this \\nRegulation, market surveillance authorities may exercise the powers referred to in Article \\n14(4)(d) and (j) of Regulation 2019/1020 remotely as appropriate.  \\n4. \\nFor high-risk AI systems placed on the market, put into service or used by financial \\ninstitutions regulated by Union legislation on financial services, the market surveillance \\nauthority for the purposes of this Regulation shall be the relevant national authority \\nresponsible for the financial supervision of those institutions under that legislation in so far \\nas the placement on the market, putting into service or the use of the AI system is in direct \\nconnection with the provision of those financial services. \\n4a. \\nBy way of a derogation from the previous subparagraph, in justified circumstances and \\nprovided that coordination is ensured, another relevant authority may be identified by the \\nMember State as market surveillance authority for the purposes of this Regulation. \\nNational market surveillance authorities supervising regulated credit institutions regulated \\nunder Directive 2013/36/EU, which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism \\n(SSM) established by Council Regulation No 1204/2013, should report, without delay, to the \\nEuropean Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market surveillance \\nactivities that may be of potential interest for the European Central Bank’s prudential \\nsupervisory tasks as specified in that Regulation. \\n5. \\nFor high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 in so far as the systems are used for law \\nenforcement purposes and for purposes listed in points 6, 7 and 8 of Annex III, Member \\nStates shall designate as market surveillance authorities for the purposes of this Regulation \\neither the competent data protection supervisory authorities under Regulation 2016/679, or \\nDirective (EU) 2016/680 or any other authority designated pursuant to the same conditions \\nlaid down in Articles 1 to 44 of Directive or Directive (EU) 2016/680. Market surveillance \\nactivities shall in no way affect the independence of judicial authorities or otherwise \\ninterfere with their activities when acting in their judicial capacity.  \\n6. \\nWhere Union institutions, agencies and bodies fall within the scope of this Regulation, the \\nEuropean Data Protection Supervisor shall act as their market surveillance authority except \\nin relation to the Court of Justice acting in its judicial capacity. \\n7. \\nMember States shall facilitate the coordination between market surveillance authorities \\ndesignated under this Regulation and other relevant national authorities or bodies which \\nsupervise the application of Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II or other \\nUnion legislation that might be relevant for the high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex \\nIII. \\n7a. \\nMarket surveillance authorities and the Commission shall be able to propose joint \\nactivities, including joint investigations, to be conducted by either market surveillance \\nauthorities or market surveillance authorities jointly with the Commission, that have the \\naim of promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness and \\nproviding guidance in relation to this Regulation with respect to specific categories of \\nhigh-risk AI systems that are found to present a serious risk across several Member States \\nin accordance with Article 9 of the 2019/1020. The AI Office shall provide coordination \\nsupport for joint investigations.  \\n7a. \\nWithout prejudice to powers provided under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, and where \\nrelevant and limited to what is necessary to fulfil their tasks, the market surveillance \\nauthorities shall be granted full access by the provider to the documentation as well as the \\ntraining, validation and testing datasets used for the development of the high-risk AI \\nsystem, including, where appropriate and subject to security safeguards, through \\napplication programming interfaces (‘API’) or other relevant technical means and tools \\nenabling remote access. \\n7b. \\nMarket surveillance authorities shall be granted access to the source code of the high-risk \\nAI system upon a reasoned request and only when the following cumulative conditions are \\nfulfilled:  \\n(a) \\naccess to source code is necessary to assess the conformity of a high-risk AI system \\nwith the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2; and \\n(b) \\ntesting/auditing procedures and verifications based on the data and documentation \\nprovided by the provider have been exhausted or proved insufficient. \\n7c. \\nAny information and documentation obtained by market surveillance authorities shall be \\ntreated in compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in Article 70. \\nArticle 63a \\n Mutual Assistance, market surveillance and control of general purpose AI systems \\n1.            Where an AI system is based on a general purpose AI model and the model and the system \\nare developed by the same provider, the AI office shall have powers to monitor and \\nsupervise compliance of this AI system with the obligations of this Regulation. To carry \\nmonitoring and supervision tasks the AI Office shall have all the powers of a market \\nsurveillance authority within the meaning of the Regulation 2019/1020. \\n2.            Where the relevant market surveillance authorities have sufficient reasons to consider that \\ngeneral purpose AI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose \\nthat is classified as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation, is non-compliant with the \\nrequirements laid down in this Regulation, it shall cooperate with the AI Office to carry out \\nevaluation of compliance and inform the Board and other market surveillance authorities \\naccordingly. \\n3.           When a national market surveillance authority is unable to conclude its investigation on the \\nhigh-risk AI system because of its inability to access certain information related to the \\ngeneral purpose AI model despite having made all appropriate efforts to obtain that \\ninformation, it may submit a reasoned request to the AI Office where access to this \\ninformation can be enforced. In this case the AI Office shall supply to the applicant \\nauthority without delay, and in any event within 30 days, any information that the AI \\nOffice considers to be relevant in order to establish whether a high-risk AI system is non-\\ncompliant. National market authorities shall safeguard the confidentiality of the \\ninformation they obtain in accordance with the Article 70. The procedure provided in \\nChapter VI of the Regulation (EU) 1020/2019 shall apply by analogy. \\nArticle 63b \\n Supervision of testing in real world conditions by market surveillance authorities \\n1. \\nMarket surveillance authorities shall have the competence and powers to ensure that testing \\nin real world conditions is in accordance with this Regulation. \\n2. \\nWhere testing in real world conditions is conducted for AI systems that are supervised \\nwithin an AI regulatory sandbox under Article 54, the market surveillance authorities shall \\nverify the compliance with the provisions of Article 54a as part of their supervisory role \\nfor the AI regulatory sandbox. Those authorities may, as appropriate, allow the testing in \\nreal world conditions to be conducted by the provider or prospective provider in derogation \\nto the conditions set out in Article 54a(4) (f) and (g). \\n3. \\nWhere a market surveillance authority has been informed by the prospective provider, the    \\nprovider or any third party of a serious incident or has other grounds for considering that \\nthe conditions set out in Articles 54a and 54b are not met, it may take any of the following \\ndecisions on its territory, as appropriate: \\n(a) \\nsuspend or terminate the testing in real world conditions; \\n(b) \\nrequire the provider or prospective provider and user(s) to modify any aspect of the \\ntesting in real world conditions. \\n4. \\nWhere a market surveillance authority has taken a decision referred to in paragraph 3 of \\nthis Article or has issued an objection within the meaning of Article 54a(4)(b), the decision \\nor the objection shall indicate the grounds thereof and the modalities and conditions for the \\nprovider or prospective provider to challenge the decision or objection. \\n5. \\nWhere applicable, where a market surveillance authority has taken a decision referred to in \\nparagraph 3 of this Article, it shall communicate the grounds therefor to the market \\nsurveillance authorities of the other Member States in which the AI system has been tested \\nin accordance with the testing plan. \\nArticle 64 \\nPowers of authorities protecting fundamental rights \\n3. \\nNational public authorities or bodies which supervise or enforce the respect of obligations \\nunder Union law protecting fundamental rights, including the right to non-discrimination, \\nin relation to the use of high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III shall have the power \\nto request and access any documentation created or maintained under this Regulation in \\naccessible language and format when access to that documentation is necessary for \\neffectively fulfilling their mandate within the limits of their jurisdiction. The relevant \\npublic authority or body shall inform the market surveillance authority of the Member \\nState concerned of any such request. \\n4. \\nBy three months after the entering into force of this Regulation, each Member State shall \\nidentify the public authorities or bodies referred to in paragraph 3 and make a list publicly \\navailable. Member States shall notify the list to the Commission and all other Member \\nStates and keep the list up to date.  \\n5. \\nWhere the documentation referred to in paragraph 3 is insufficient to ascertain whether a \\nbreach of obligations under Union law intended to protect fundamental rights has occurred, \\nthe public authority or body referred to in paragraph 3 may make a reasoned request to the \\nmarket surveillance authority, to organise testing of the high-risk AI system through \\ntechnical means. The market surveillance authority shall organise the testing with the close \\ninvolvement of the requesting public authority or body within reasonable time following \\nthe request. \\n6. \\nAny information and documentation obtained by the national public authorities or bodies \\nreferred to in paragraph 3 pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall be treated in \\ncompliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in Article 70. \\nArticle 65 \\nProcedure for dealing with AI systems presenting a risk at national level \\n1. \\nAI systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a product presenting a risk defined in \\nArticle 3, point 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 insofar as risks to the health or safety or \\nto fundamental rights of persons are concerned. \\n2. \\nWhere the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reasons to \\nconsider that an AI system presents a risk as referred to in paragraph 1, it shall carry out an \\nevaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the \\nrequirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Particular attention shall be \\ngiven to AI systems presenting a risk to vulnerable groups (referred to in Article 5). When \\nrisks to fundamental rights are identified, the market surveillance authority shall also \\ninform and fully cooperate with the relevant national public authorities or bodies referred \\nto in Article 64(3). The relevant operators shall cooperate as necessary with the market \\nsurveillance authority and the other national public authorities or bodies referred to in \\nArticle 64(3). \\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority and where \\napplicable in cooperation with the national public authority referred to in Article 64(3) \\nfinds that the AI system does not comply with the requirements and obligations laid down \\nin this Regulation, it shall without undue delay require the relevant operator to take all \\nappropriate corrective actions to bring the AI system into compliance, to withdraw the AI \\nsystem from the market, or to recall it within a period it may prescribe and in any event no \\nlater than fifteen working days or as provided for in the relevant Union harmonisation law \\nas applicable \\nThe market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. \\nArticle 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the measures referred to in the \\nsecond subparagraph.  \\n3. \\nWhere the market surveillance authority considers that non-compliance is not restricted to \\nits national territory, it shall inform the Commission, and the other Member States without \\nundue delay of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has required the \\noperator to take. \\n4. \\nThe operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the \\nAI systems concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union. \\n5. \\nWhere the operator of an AI system does not take adequate corrective action within the \\nperiod referred to in paragraph 2, the market surveillance authority shall take all \\nappropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the AI system\\'s being made \\navailable on its national market or put into service, to withdraw the product or the \\nstandalone AI system from that market or to recall it. That authority shall without undue \\ndelay notify the Commission and the other Member States of those measures. \\n6. \\nThe notification referred to in paragraph 5 shall include all available details, in particular \\nthe information necessary for the identification of the non-compliant AI system, the origin \\nof the AI system and the supply chain, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the \\nrisk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put \\nforward by the relevant operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall \\nindicate whether the non-compliance is due to one or more of the following: \\n(-a)  non-compliance with the prohibition of the artificial intelligence practices referred to \\nin Article 5; \\n(a) \\na failure of a high-risk AI system to meet requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2; \\n(b) \\nshortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications referred to in \\nArticles 40 and 41 conferring a presumption of conformity; \\n(ba)  non-compliance with provisions set out in Article 52. \\n7. \\nThe market surveillance authorities of the Member States other than the market \\nsurveillance authority of the Member State initiating the procedure shall without undue \\ndelay inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of \\nany additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the AI \\nsystem concerned, and, in the event of disagreement with the notified national measure, of \\ntheir objections. \\n8. \\nWhere, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 5, no \\nobjection has been raised by either a market surveillance authority of a Member State or \\nthe Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a market surveillance \\nauthority of another Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified. This is without \\nprejudice to the procedural rights of the concerned operator in accordance with Article 18 \\nof Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. The period referred to in the first sentence of this \\nparagraph shall be reduced to thirty days in the event of non-compliance with the \\nprohibition of the artificial intelligence practices referred to in Article 5. \\n9. \\nThe market surveillance authorities of all Member States shall ensure that appropriate \\nrestrictive measures are taken in respect of the product or the AI system concerned, such as \\nwithdrawal of the product or the AI system from their market, without undue delay. \\nArticle 65a \\nProcedure for dealing with AI systems classified by the provider as a not high-risk in \\napplication of Annex III \\n1. \\nWhere a market surveillance authority has sufficient reasons to consider that an AI system \\nclassified by the provider as non-high-risk in application of Annex III is high-risk, they \\nmarket surveillance authority shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in \\nrespect of its classification as a high-risk AI system based on the conditions set out in \\nAnnex III and the Commission guidelines. \\n2. \\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the AI \\nsystem concerned is high-risk, it shall without undue delay require the relevant provider to \\ntake all necessary actions to bring the AI system into compliance with the requirements \\nand obligations laid down in this Regulation as well as take appropriate corrective action \\nwithin a period it may prescribe. \\n3. \\nWhere the market surveillance authority considers that the use of the AI system concerned \\nis not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other \\nMember States without undue delay of the results of the evaluation and of the actions \\nwhich it has required the provider to take.  \\n4. \\nThe provider shall ensure that all necessary action is taken to bring the AI system into \\ncompliance with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Where the \\nprovider of an AI system concerned does not bring the AI system into compliance with the \\nrequirements and obligations of this Regulation within the period referred to in paragraph \\n2, the provider shall be subject to fines in accordance with Article 71. \\n5. \\nThe provider shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the \\nAI systems concerned that it has made available on the market throughout the Union. \\n6. \\nWhere the provider of the AI system concerned does not take adequate corrective action \\nwithin the period referred to in paragraph 2, then the provisions of Article 65 paragraphs 5 \\nto 9 apply.  \\n7. \\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation pursuant to paragraph 1, the market surveillance \\nauthority establishes that the AI system was misclassified by the provider as not high-risk \\nto circumvent the application of requirements in Title III, Chapter 2, the provider shall be \\nsubject to fines in accordance with Article 71. \\n8. \\nIn exercising their power to monitor the application of this article and in accordance with \\nArticle 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, market surveillance authorities may perform \\nappropriate checks, taking into account in particular information stored in the EU database \\nreferred to in Article 60. \\nArticle 66 \\nUnion safeguard procedure \\n1. \\nWhere, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 65(5), or 30 \\ndays in the case of non-compliance with the prohibition of the artificial intelligence \\npractices referred to in Article 5, objections are raised by the market surveillance authority \\nof a Member State against a measure taken by another market surveillance authority, or \\nwhere the Commission considers the measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission \\nshall without undue delay enter into consultation with the market surveillance authority of \\nthe relevant Member State and operator or operators and shall evaluate the national \\nmeasure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide \\nwhether the national measure is justified or not within six months, or 60 days in the case of \\nnon-compliance with the prohibition of the artificial intelligence practices referred to in \\nArticle 5, starting from the notification referred to in Article 65(5) and notify such decision \\nto the market surveillance authority of the Member State concerned. The Commission shall \\nalso inform all other market surveillance authorities of such decision.  \\n2. \\nIf the measure taken by the relevant Member States is considered justified by the \\nCommission, all Member States shall ensure that appropriate restrictive measures are taken \\nin respect of the AI system concerned, such as withdrawal of the AI system from their \\nmarket without undue delay, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. If the national \\nmeasure is considered unjustified by the Commission, the Member State concerned shall \\nwithdraw the measure and inform the Commission accordingly. \\n3. \\nWhere the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the AI \\nsystem is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications \\nreferred to in Articles 40 and 41 of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the \\nprocedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. \\nArticle 67 \\nCompliant AI systems which present a risk \\n1. \\nWhere, having performed an evaluation under Article 65, after consulting  the relevant \\nnational public authority referred to in Article 64(3), the market surveillance authority of a \\nMember State finds that although a high-risk AI system is in compliance with this \\nRegulation, it presents a  risk to the health or safety of persons, fundamental rights, or to \\nother aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant operator to take all \\nappropriate measures to ensure that the AI system concerned, when placed on the market \\nor put into service, no longer presents that risk without undue delay, within a period it may \\nprescribe. \\n2. \\nThe provider or other relevant operators shall ensure that corrective action is taken in \\nrespect of all the AI systems concerned that they have made available on the market \\nthroughout the Union within the timeline prescribed by the market surveillance authority of \\nthe Member State referred to in paragraph 1.  \\n3. \\nThe Member States shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member \\nStates.

       "['INTRODUCTION The Commission adopted the proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act, hereinafter: the AI Act) on 21 April 2021. The Council unanimously adopted its General Approach on the proposal on 6 December 2022, while the European Parliament (hereinafter: the EP) confirmed its position in a plenary vote on 14 June 2023. On 14 June 2023, 18 July 2023, 2-3 October 2023 and 24 October 2023 the first four political trilogues were held, during which some of the less controversial parts of the proposal were agreed and compromise was also found on the provisions concerning measures in support of innovation, as well as and on the mechanism for classification of AI systems as high-risk. Moreover, during those initial trilogues the co-legislators explored potential landing zones with regard to the remaining issues, in particular the regulation of general purpose AI models and systems, governance, as well the prohibitions and law enforcement package. On 29 November 2023 and 1 December 2023, the Committee of Permanent Representatives granted the Presidency a revised mandate to continue the negotiations on all the outstanding elements of the proposal. The fifth and final trilogue was held between 6 and 8 December 2023. During this extended round of negotiations the Council and the EP came to an agreement on all political issues and successfully closed the interinstitutional negotiations. Following this political agreement, the co-legislators proceeded to carry out further technical work in January 2024 in order to align the text of the recitals with the text of the articles as agreed during the final trilogue. In the Annex to this document delegations will find the text of the proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (the AI Act), updated according to the provisional political agreement reached at the fifth trilogue between 6 and 8 December 2023. MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE COMPROMISE 1. Subject matter and scope As regards the subject matter, the compromise text of Article 1(1) includes a high-level statement that one of the purposes of the AI Act is to ensure a high level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, which includes democracy, rule of law and environmental protection. However, all subsequent references in the text to the risks addressed by the Regulation only include risks to health, safety and fundamental rights, in line with the Council’s mandate.',\n",
       " 'Concerning the scope, the compromise text makes it clear that national security is excluded. The wording concerning this exclusion in Article 2(3) has been fine tuned to align it more closely with the respective language used in recently agreed legal acts, such as the Cyber Resilience Act and the Data Act, while the text of the corresponding Recital 12a has remained the same as in the Council’s mandate. Definition of an AI system The definition of an AI system in Article 3(1) has been modified to align it more closely with the work of international organisations working on artificial intelligence, notably the OECD. Moreover, the corresponding Recital 6 details further the key characteristics of the definition and clarifies that the definition is not intended to cover simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches, which are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations. Additionally, the Commission has been tasked to develop guidelines on the application of the definition of an AI system. Prohibited AI practices Regarding the list of prohibited AI practices in Article 5, the compromise text includes the changes as previously accepted by the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the Council’s revised mandate. This means that the list includes the prohibition of real-time biometric identification by law enforcement authorities in publicly accessible spaces, but with some notable and clearly defined exceptions, as listed in Article 5(1)(d), which are now subject to a range of safeguards, including monitoring and oversight measures and limited reporting obligations at EU level. Additional accepted prohibitions include untargeted scraping of facial images for the purpose of a creating or expanding facial recognition databases, emotion recognition but only at the workplace and in educational institutions (and with exceptions for safety and medical reasons), a very limited prohibition of biometric categorization based on certain specific beliefs or characteristics, as well as a limited and targeted ban on individual predictive policing. The wording on the predictive policing ban has been slightly modified and it now covers systems which assess or predict the risk of a natural person to commit a criminal offence, based solely on the profiling of a natural person or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics. However, this prohibition will not apply to AI systems used to support the human assessment of the involvement of a person in a criminal activity.',\n",
       " 'Finally, it is important to point out that as part of the compromise other biometric categorisation systems and emotion recognition systems, as well as post-remote biometric identification systems, which have not been included in the list of prohibitions in Article 5, have been added to Annex III (List of high-risk AI systems), with some further limitations of their scope. Post-remote biometric identification In addition to being included in the list of high-risk AI systems in Annex III, the use of post-remote biometric identification by law enforcement authorities has been made subject to some additional safeguards in Article 29. These safeguards include some limited transparency measures and the requirement for law enforcement authorities to request an authorisation for the use of post-remote biometric identification, which could be given by a judicial authority or an administrative authority whose decision is binding and subject to a judicial review. This can be done prior or ex post, within 48 hours. Furthermore, the compromise text clarifies that post-remote biometric identification should not be used for law enforcement purposes in an untargeted way without any link to a criminal offence, a criminal proceeding, a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a criminal offence or the search for a specific missing person. Exceptions for law enforcement authorities The compromise agreement preserves all the exceptions for law enforcement authorities that were added in the Council’s revised mandate, including derogation from conformity assessment and the possibility to start real world testing of high-risk AI systems without prior authorisation. Nevertheless, in order to secure these concessions, the Council had to agree that market surveillance authorities for high-risk AI systems in the field of law enforcement would be either the data protection authorities or any other authorities designated pursuant to conditions laid down in Articles 1 to 44 of the Law Enforcement Directive. Fundamental rights impact assessment In line with the Council’s revised mandate, in Article 29a the compromise text includes a light version of the obligation for some deployers to conduct a fundamental rights impact assessment. The obligation is relatively easy to comply with, and it concerns only deployers that are bodies governed by public law, private actors providing public services, and deployers that are banking and insurance service providers using AI systems listed as high- risk in Annex III, point 5, (b) and (ca).',\n",
       " 'The fundamental rights impact assessment will need to be carried out only for aspects not covered by other legal obligations, such as Data Protection Impact Assessment under the GDPR and will be procedurally aligned with existing processes in order to eliminate any overlap and additional burden. Moreover, compliance with this obligation will be facilitated by the AI Office, which has been tasked with the development of a template for a questionnaire which deployers will be able to use to meet the relevant requirements. Testing high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes As part of the compromise, the text of the AI Act includes provisions on testing high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes, in Articles 54a and 54b. The Council’s revised mandate has been preserved in this respect, which means that testing high-risk AI systems in real world conditions outside AI regulatory sandboxes will be possible, but it will be subject to a range of safeguards, which include, inter alia, the requirement for approval from the market surveillance authority, the right for affected persons to request to delete their data after testing in real world conditions, the right for market surveillance authorities to request information related to testing in real world conditions from providers, including the power to conduct inspections, limited duration of such testing, as well as some additional safeguards designed specifically for testing in real world conditions in the areas of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management. General purpose AI models The compromise agreement includes new provisions concerning general purpose AI models (GPAI models) in Articles 52a – 52e. These new rules introduce horizontal obligations for all GPAI models, which will include keeping up-to-date and making available, upon request, technical documentation to the AI Office and national competent authorities. They also include providing certain information and documentation to downstream providers for the purpose of compliance with the AI Act. There are some additional requirements for models with systemic risks, which would include performing model evaluation, making risk assessments and taking risk mitigation measures, ensuring an adequate level of cybersecurity protection, and reporting serious incidents to the AI Office and national competent authorities. Compliance with these requirements can be achieved through codes of practice, which will be developed by the industry, with the participation of the Member States (through the AI Board), and facilitated by the AI Office. The drawing up of the codes of practice should be an open process to which all interested stakeholders will be invited, both companies as well as civil society and academia.',\n",
       " 'The AI Office will also evaluate these codes of practice and can formally approve them, or, in case they are inadequate to cover the obligations, provide common rules for the implementation of the obligations through an implementing act. The compromise agreement also provides that standards will be a possibility for compliance in the future. Classification of GPAI models as presenting systemic risks will initially depend on the capability, either based on a quantitative threshold of the cumulative amount of compute used for its training measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), or on an individual designation decision of the Commission that takes into account criteria listed in Annex IXc (e. the number of parameters, quality and size of the dataset, input and output modalities or the reach measures in business users). The initial FLOPs threshold for this has been set as 10^25, so higher than what the EP initially wanted but lower than in the Council’s mandate, which was 10^26. However, in this context it is important to note that the Commission will be obliged to adapt the threshold in the light of evolving technological developments, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, in order to keep up with the state of the art, reflecting the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general purpose AI models. Regarding copyright, the compromise agreement states that providers of GPAI models will need to put in place a policy to respect Union copyright law, as well as make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training of the general- purpose AI model, based on a template provided by the AI Office. Recital 60k explains that this summary should not be technically detailed but comprehensive at a general level, while taking into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information. Finally, with regard to GPAI systems, the compromise agreement defines them as AI systems based on GPAI models that can serve a variety of purposes. Article 28 includes rules to align them to the risk-based approach of the AI Act. Providers of such systems will be obliged to provide all the information and elements to downstream providers of high-risk AI systems so that they can comply with the respective requirements, including for the purpose of conformity assessment. Article 63a further clarifies the conditions in which national market surveillance authorities should collaborate with the AI Office to ensure the compliance of GPAI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose classified as high-risk, when they consider the GPAI systems are not compliant.',\n",
       " 'Governance and enforcement Linked to the agreements on GPAI models, as summarized in point 8 above, the compromise text also includes the new rules on governance in Title VI. While for AI systems the market surveillance system on the national level will apply, these new rules for GPAI models provide for a new more centralised system of oversight and enforcement. For this purpose, the AI Office will be established as a new governance structure with a number of specific tasks in respect of GPAI models, and with a strong link with the scientific community to support its work. The newly proposed governance structure also includes an enhanced role for the AI Board. Its list of tasks has been extended to give the Member States a stronger coordination role, including with regard to AI regulatory sandboxes, consultations with stakeholders and awareness raising activities. The AI Board will also provide opinions to the Commission on the qualified alerts concerning general purpose AI models. The provisions on the composition and functioning of the AI Board have been maintained as in the Council’s General Approach. The final text also introduces two new advisory bodies. A scientific panel of independent experts will provide technical advice and input to the AI Office and market surveillance authorities. The scientific panel also has a key role in the enforcement of rules for GPAI models, as it will be able to launch qualified alerts of possible risks to the AI Office. Building on the General Approach, Member States will have the possibility to call upon experts of the scientific panels to support their market surveillance activities. An advisory forum will provide stakeholder input to the Commission (including the AI Office) and to the AI Board. It will comprise a balanced selection of stakeholders, including industry, start- ups, SMEs, civil society and academia. Finally, on the issue of appointing more than one competent authority covered by Article 59(2), the compromise text maintains the Council’s position, which gives the Member States the flexibility to appoint at least one notifying authority and at least one market surveillance authority as national competent authorities. In addition, Member States shall designate one market surveillance authority to act as a single point of contact. Derogation from conformity assessment In line with the Council’s mandate, the compromise text preserves the derogation from conformity assessment in Article 47(1), and also the related exemption (urgency procedure) for law enforcement authorities in Article 47(1a), without the need for judicial authorisation.',\n",
       " 'However, to secure this concession, it has been necessary to re-introduce in the text the wording regarding the control of the authorisation process by the Commission, as provided in points 3, 4 and 5 of Article 47, which were previously deleted in the Council’s General Approach. AI systems already placed on the market or put into service Concerning AI systems already placed on the market or put into service, in the case of public authorities which are providers or deployers of high-risk AI systems the compromise agreement in Article 83(2) is to offer them 4 years from the entry into application to make their systems compliant. This change does not depart significantly from the Council’s position, as it is highly unlikely that within this 4-year period such systems would not go through a substantial modification, which was supposed to trigger the requirement to comply in the Council’s General Approach. Moreover, in Article 83(3) it has been agreed that every GPAI model that is placed on the market before the entry into application of the provisions related to GPAI models (12 months after entry into force) will have 2 years after the date if entry into application of these provisions (3 years in total) to be brought in compliance (irrespective of whether there is a substantial modification or not). Implementing acts and delegated acts With regard to delegated and implementing acts, the compromise text preserves the choices as in the Council’s revised mandate, with the exception of two cases of implementing acts where it was clarified that legally only delegated acts are possible, namely to update the thresholds of FLOPs in Article 52a and to update the methodology for the classification of high-impact models in Article 52b. Penalties The amounts of penalties for the infringements of the various aspects of the AI Act have been fine tuned in Article 71. Notably, for non-compliance with the provisions concerning prohibited AI practices outlined in Article 5, the penalty has been set at 35 million EUR or 7% of annual turnover, slightly above the limit set in the Council’s revised mandate, which was 35 million EUR or 6. 5% of annual turnover. On the other hand, the amounts of penalties agreed for the remaining cases are slightly lower than in the Council’s position. Finally, Article 72a sets out the fines for providers of general purpose AI models, in case of infringements of the obligations or non-compliance with the enforcement measures, e. requests for information.',\n",
       " 'The maximum amount of fines has been aligned to those for providers of high-risk AI systems. It is important to highlight that there will be an additional grace period for providers of general purpose AI models, because no fines can be imposed during the first year after entry into application of the rules. Entry into application On the entry of application as specified in Article 85, the compromise agreement provides for 24 months with regard to most parts of the Regulation, with slightly shorter deadlines for some elements, namely 6 months for prohibitions and 12 months for provisions concerning notifying authorities and notified bodies, governance, general purpose AI models, confidentiality and penalties, and a slightly longer deadline of 36 months for high-risk AI systems covered by Annex II. CONCLUSION 1. The Presidency invites the Committee of the Permanent Representatives to: a. endorse the annexed compromise text as agreed with the European Parliament during the final trilogue, and b. mandate the Presidency to inform the European Parliament that, should the European Parliament adopt its position at first reading, in accordance with Article 294 paragraph 3 of the Treaty, in the form set out in the compromise package contained in the Annex to this document (subject to revision by the lawyer linguists of both institutions), the Council would, in accordance with Article 294, paragraph 4 of the Treaty, approve the European Parliament’s position and the act shall be adopted in the wording which corresponds to the European Parliament’s position.',\n",
       " '_______________________ ANNEX 2021/0106 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACT) AND AMENDING CERTAIN UNION LEGISLATIVE ACTS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 16 and 114 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission, After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee1, Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank2, Having regard to the joint opinion of the European Data Protection Board and the European Data Protection Supervisor, Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions3, Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, Whereas: (1) The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal framework in particular for the development, placing on the  market, putting into service and the use of artificial intelligence systems in the Union in conformity with Union values, to promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy and rule of law and environmental protection, against harmful effects of artificial intelligence systems in the Union and to support innovation. This regulation ensures the free movement of AI-based goods and services cross-border, thus preventing Member States from imposing restrictions on the development, marketing and use of Artificial Intelligence systems (AI systems), unless explicitly authorised by this Regulation. (1a) This Regulation should be applied in conformity with the values of the Union enshrined in the Charter facilitating the protection of individuals, companies, democracy and rule of law and the environment while boosting innovation and employment and making the Union a leader in the uptake of trustworthy AI. (2) AI systems can be easily deployed in multiple sectors of the economy and society, including cross border, and circulate throughout the Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to ensure that artificial intelligence is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in compliance with fundamental rights obligations.',\n",
       " 'Differing national rules may lead to fragmentation of the internal market and decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the free circulation, innovation, deployment and uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market should be prevented, by laying down uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market based on Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, for the use of AI systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and for the use of AI systems of biometric categorization for the purpose of law enforcement, it is appropriate to base this Regulation, in as far as those specific rules are concerned, on Article 16 of the TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board. (3) Artificial intelligence is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide array of economic, environmental and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of artificial intelligence can provide key competitive advantages to companies and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, farming, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, infrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy efficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation. (4) At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use, and level of technological development, artificial intelligence may generate risks and cause harm to public interests and fundamental rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm might be material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic harm.',\n",
       " '(4a) Given the major impact that artificial intelligence can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital for artificial intelligence and its regulatory framework to be developed according to Union values enshrined in Article 2 TEU, the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties, the Charter. As a pre-requisite, artificial intelligence should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being. (4aa) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for all high-risk AI systems should be established. Those rules should be consistent with the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union (the Charter) and should be non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should also take into account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade (2023/C 23/01) and the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence. (5) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence is therefore needed to foster the development, use and uptake of artificial intelligence in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, rule of law and environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the placing on the market, putting into service and use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. These rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling to a European ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on SMEs including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of promoting the European human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical artificial intelligence as stated by the European Council4, and it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the the European Parliament5.',\n",
       " '(5a) The harmonised rules on the placing on the market, putting into service and use of AI systems laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with its New Legislative Framework approach, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, notably on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, and protection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is complementary. As a consequence all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and other persons who may be negatively impacted by AI systems, including as regards the compensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, remain unaffected and fully applicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and protection of workers, this Regulation should therefore not affect Union law on social policy and national labour law, in compliance with Union law, concerning employment and working conditions, including  health and safety at work and the relationship between employers and workers. This Regulation should also not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and at Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by the specific industrial relations systems in Member States as well as, the right to negotiate, to conclude and enforce collective agreements or to take collective action in accordance with national law. [This Regulation should not affect the provisions aiming to improve working conditions in platform work set out in Directive. [COD 2021/414/EC]] On top of that, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, including in respect of transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national laws, in compliance with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such laws fall outside the scope of this Regulation or pursue other legitimate public interest objectives than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national labour law and the laws on the protection of minors (i. persons below the age of 18) taking into account the United Nations General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legitimate public interest objectives, should not be affected by this Regulation.',\n",
       " '(5aa) The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive 2016/680. Directive 2002/58/EC additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, including by way of providing conditions for any personal and non-personal data storing in and access from terminal equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for sustainable and responsible data processing, including where datasets include a mix of personal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application of existing Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and powers of the independent supervisory authorities competent to monitor compliance with those instruments. It also does not affect the obligations of providers and deployers of AI systems in their role as data controllers or processors stemming from national or Union law on the protection of personal data in so far as the design, the development or the use of AI systems involves the processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that data subjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such Union law, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of AI systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the effective implementation and enable the exercise of the data subjects’ rights and other remedies guaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other fundamental rights. (5ab) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of intermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [as amended by the Digital Services Act]. (6) The notion of AI system in this Regulation should be clearly defined and closely aligned with the work of international organisations working on artificial intelligence to ensure legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing the flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field. Moreover, it should be based on key characteristics of artificial intelligence systems, that distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to infer. This inference refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual environments and to a capability of AI systems to derive models and/or algorithms from inputs/data.',\n",
       " 'The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives. and logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or symbolic representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer goes beyond basic data processing, enable learning, reasoning or modelling. The term “machine-based” refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. The reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate according to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI system may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context. For the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood as the contexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system, reflect different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content, recommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human involvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness that an AI system could exhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, allowing the system to change while in use. AI systems can be used on a stand-alone basis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically integrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the product without being integrated therein (non-embedded). (6a) The notion of ‘deployer’ referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any natural or legal person, including a public authority, agency or other body, using an AI system under its authority, except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal non- professional activity. Depending on the type of AI system, the use of the system may affect persons other than the deployer. (7) The notion of biometric data used in this Regulation should be interpreted in light of the notion of biometric data as defined in Article 4(14) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council 6, Article 3(18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 7 and Article 3(13) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council 8. Biometric data can allow for the authentication, identification or categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of emotions of natural persons.',\n",
       " '(7a) The notion of biometric identification as used in this Regulation should be defined as the automated recognition of physical, physiological and behavioural human features such as the face, eye movement, body shape, voice, prosody, gait, posture, heart rate, blood pressure, odour, keystrokes characteristics, for the purpose of establishing an individual’s identity by comparing biometric data of that individual to stored biometric data of individuals in a reference database, irrespective of whether the individual has given its consent or not. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural  person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. (7b) The notion of biometric categorisation as used in this Regulation should be defined as assigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data. Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, behavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national minority, sexual or political orientation. This does not include biometric categorization systems that are a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial service meaning that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without the principal service and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to circumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters categorizing facial or body features used on online marketplaces could constitute such an ancillary feature as they can only be used in relation to the principal service which consists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the product on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters used on online social network services which categorise facial or body features to allow users to add or modify pictures or videos could also be considered as ancillary feature as such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network services consisting in the sharing of content online.',\n",
       " '(8) The notion of remote biometric identification system as used in this Regulation should be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. This exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-time’ use of the AI systems in question by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-‘live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, the biometric data have already been captured and the comparison and identification occur only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned. (8a) The notion of emotion recognition system for the purpose of this regulation should be defined as an AI system for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data.',\n",
       " 'This refers to emotions or intentions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, embarrassment, excitement, shame, contempt, satisfaction and amusement. It does not include physical states, such as pain or fatigue. It does not refer for example to systems used in detecting the state of fatigue of professional pilots or drivers for the purpose of preventing accidents. It does also not include the mere detection of readily apparent expressions, gestures or movements, unless they are used for identifying or inferring emotions. These expressions can be basic facial expressions such as a frown or a smile, or gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or head, or characteristics of a person’s voice, for example a raised voice or whispering. (9) For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of publicly accessible space should be understood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to an undetermined number of natural persons, and irrespective of whether the place in question is privately or publicly owned and irrespective of the activity for which the place may be used, such as commerce (for instance, shops, restaurants, cafés), services (for instance, banks, professional activities, hospitality), sport (for instance, swimming pools, gyms, stadiums), transport (for instance, bus, metro and railway stations, airports, means of transport ), entertainment (for instance, cinemas, theatres, museums, concert and conference halls) leisure or otherwise (for instance, public roads and squares, parks, forests, playgrounds). A place should be classified as publicly accessible also if, regardless of potential capacity or security restrictions, access is subject to certain predetermined conditions, which can be fulfilled by an undetermined number of persons, such as purchase of a ticket or title of transport, prior registration or having a certain age. By contrast, a place should not be considered publicly accessible if access is limited to specific and defined natural persons through either Union or national law directly related to public safety or security or through the clear manifestation of will by the person having the relevant authority on the place. The factual possibility of access alone (e. an unlocked door, an open gate in a fence) does not imply that the place is publicly accessible in the presence of indications or circumstances suggesting the contrary (e. signs prohibiting or restricting access). Company and factory premises as well as offices and workplaces that are intended to be accessed only by relevant employees and service providers are places that are not publicly accessible. Publicly accessible spaces should not include prisons or border control.',\n",
       " \"Some other areas may be composed of both not publicly accessible and publicly accessible areas, such as the hallway of a private residential building necessary to access a doctor's office or an airport. Online spaces are not covered either, as they are not physical spaces. Whether a given space is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand. (9b) In order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental rights, health and safety and to enable democratic control, AI literacy should equip providers, deployers and affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed decisions regarding AI systems. These notions may vary with regard to the relevant context and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements during the AI system’s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the suitable ways in which to interpret the AI system’s output, and, in the case of affected persons, the knowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the assistance of AI will impact them. In the context of the application this Regulation, AI literacy should provide all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights required to ensure the appropriate compliance and its correct enforcement. Furthermore, the wide implementation of AI literacy measures and the introduction of appropriate follow-up actions could contribute to improving working conditions and ultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union. The European Artificial Intelligence Board should support the Commission, to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding of the benefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems. In cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States should facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy among persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI. (10) In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems established within the Union. (11) In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this Regulation even when they are neither placed on the market, nor put into service, nor used in the Union.\",\n",
       " 'This is the case for example of an operator established in the Union that contracts certain services to an operator established outside the Union in relation to an activity to be performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk. In those circumstances, the AI system used by the operator outside the Union could process data lawfully collected in and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is intended to be used in the Union. Nonetheless, to take into account existing arrangements and special needs for future cooperation with foreign partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this Regulation should not apply to public authorities of a third country and international organisations when acting in the framework of cooperation or international agreements concluded at national or European level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or with its Member States, under the condition that this third country or international organisations provide adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Where relevant, this may also cover activities of entities entrusted by the third countries to carry out specific tasks in support of such law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Such framework for cooperation or agreements have been established bilaterally between Member States and third countries or between the European Union, Europol and other EU agencies and third countries and international organisations. The authorities competent for supervision of the law enforcement and judicial authorities under the AI Act should assess whether these frameworks for cooperation or international agreements include adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Recipient Member States authorities and Union institutions, offices and bodies making use of such outputs in the Union remain accountable to ensure their use complies with Union law. When those international agreements are revised or new ones are concluded in the future, the contracting parties should undertake the utmost effort to align those agreements with the requirements of this Regulation. (12) This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, offices, bodies and agencies when acting as a provider or deployer of an AI system.',\n",
       " '(12a) If and insofar AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or without modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes, those should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation regardless of which type of entity is carrying out those activities, such as whether it is a public or private entity. As regards military and defence purposes, such exclusion is justified both by Article 4(2) TEU and by the specificities of the Member States’ and the common Union defence policy covered by Chapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) that are subject to public international law, which is therefore the more appropriate legal framework for the regulation of AI systems in the context of the use of lethal force and other AI systems in the context of military and defence activities. As regards national security purposes, the exclusion is justified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility of Member States in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and operational needs of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to those activities. Nonetheless, if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into service or used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those temporarily or permanently for other purposes (for example, civilian or humanitarian purposes, law enforcement or public security purposes), such a system would fall within the scope of this Regulation. In that case, the entity using the system for other than military, defence or national security purposes should ensure compliance of the system with this Regulation, unless the system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI systems placed on the market or put into service for an excluded (i. military, defence or national security) and one or more non excluded purposes (e. civilian purposes, law enforcement, etc. ), fall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems should ensure compliance with this Regulation. In those cases, the fact that an AI system may fall within the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of entities carrying out national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and defence purposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this Regulation. An AI system placed on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes which is used with or without modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall within the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those activities.',\n",
       " '(12c) This Regulation should support innovation, respect freedom of science, and should not undermine research and development activity. It is therefore necessary to exclude from its scope AI systems and models specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that the Regulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and development activity on AI systems or models prior to being placed on the market or put into service. As regards product oriented research, testing and development activity regarding AI systems or models, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply prior to these systems and models being put into service or placed on the market. This is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation when an AI system falling into the scope of this Regulation is placed on the market or put into service as a result of such research and development activity and to the application of provisions on regulatory sandboxes and testing in real world conditions. Furthermore, without prejudice to the foregoing regarding AI systems specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development, any other AI system that may be used for the conduct of any research and development activity should remain subject to the provisions of this Regulation. Under all circumstances, any research and development activity should be carried out in accordance with recognised ethical and professional standards for scientific research and should be conducted according to applicable Union law. (14) In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable artificial intelligence practices, to lay down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems. (14a) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed by the independent High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) appointed by the Commission. In those Guidelines the HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which should help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven principles include: human agency and oversight. technical robustness and safety. privacy and data governance. transparency. diversity, non-discrimination and fairness. societal and environmental well-being and accountability.',\n",
       " 'Without prejudice to the legally binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, these Guidelines contribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric Artificial Intelligence, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to the Guidelines of HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in compliance with existing privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of these principles should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account as appropriate the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards. (15) Aside from the many beneficial uses of artificial intelligence, that technology can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices.',\n",
       " 'Such practices are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy and the rule of law and Union fundamental rights, including the right to non-discrimination, data protection and privacy and the rights of the child. (16) AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on the market, putting into service or use of certain AI systems with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should therefore be forbidden. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive as those stimuli are beyond human perception or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s autonomy, decision- making or free choices in ways that people are not consciously aware of, or even if aware they are still deceived or not able to control or resist. This could be for example, facilitated by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they may be materially distorting their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may be accumulated over time and should therefore be prohibited. The intention to distort the behaviour may not be presumed if the distortion results from factors external to the AI system which are outside of the control of the provider or the deployer, meaning factors that may not be reasonably foreseen and mitigated by the provider or the deployer of the AI system.',\n",
       " 'In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the intention to cause significant harm, as long as such harm results from the manipulative or exploitative AI-enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices are complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/29/EC, notably unfair commercial practices leading to economic or financial harms to consumers are prohibited under all circumstances, irrespective of whether they are put in place through AI systems or otherwise. The prohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this Regulation should not affect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as psychological treatment of a mental disease or physical rehabilitation, when those practices are carried out in accordance with the applicable legislation and medical standards, for example explicit consent of the individuals or their legal representatives. In addition, common and legitimate commercial practices, for example in the field of advertising, that are in compliance with the applicable law should not in themselves be regarded as constituting harmful manipulative AI practices. (16a) Biometric categorisation systems that are based on individuals’ biometric data, such as an individual person’s face or fingerprint, to deduce or infer an individuals’ political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, race, sex life or sexual orientation should be prohibited. This prohibition does not cover the lawful labelling, filtering or categorisation of biometric datasets acquired in line with Union or national law according to biometric data, such as the sorting of images according to hair colour or eye colour, which can for example be used in the area of law enforcement. (17) AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons by public or private actors may lead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the right to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI systems evaluate or classify natural persons or groups thereof based on multiple data points related to their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics over certain periods of time. The social score obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable treatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated to the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental treatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. AI systems entailing such unacceptable scoring practices leading to such detrimental or unfavourable outcomes should be therefore prohibited.',\n",
       " 'This prohibition should not affect lawful evaluation practices of natural persons done for a specific purpose in compliance with national and Union law. (18) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems operating in ‘real-time’ carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons that are concerned by law enforcement activities. (19) The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime including missing people. certain threats to the life or physical safety of natural persons or of a terrorist attack. and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or suspects of the criminal offences referred to in Annex IIa if those criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the law of that Member State. Such threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in accordance with national law contributes to ensure that the offence should be serious enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, the list of criminal offences as referred in Annex IIa is based on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA9, taking into account that some are in practice likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric  identification will foreseeably be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical pursuit of the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences. An imminent threat to life or physical safety of natural persons could also result from a serious disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (a) of Directive 2008/114/EC, where the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in an imminent threat to life or physical safety of a person, including through serious harm to the provision of basic supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core function of the State. In addition, this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the person that is concerned in accordance with the conditions set out in Union and national law for such checks. In particular, law enforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities should be able to use information systems, in accordance with Union or national law, to identify a person who, during an identity check, either refuses to be identified or is unable to state or prove his or her identity, without being required by this Regulation to obtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved in a crime, being unwilling, or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities. (20) In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it is also important to establish that, in each of those exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards the nature of the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the rights and freedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the use.',\n",
       " 'In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should only be deployed to confirm the specifically target individual’s identity and should be limited to what is strictly necessary concerning the period of time as well as geographic and personal scope, having regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims or perpetrator. The use of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces should only be authorised if the law enforcement authority has completed a fundamental rights impact assessment and, unless provided otherwise in this Regulation, has registered the system in the database as set out in this Regulation. The reference database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the situations mentioned above. (21) Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of a Member State. Such authorisation should in principle be obtained prior to the use of the system with a view to identify a person or persons. Exceptions to this rule should be allowed in duly justified situations of urgency, that is, situations where the need to use the systems in question is such as to make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before commencing the use. In such situations of urgency, the use should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and be subject to appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such authorisation whilst providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, without undue delay and, at the latest within 24 hours. If such authorisation is rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation should be stopped with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use linked to that authorisation. It should not include input legally acquired in accordance with another national or Union law. In any case, no decision producing an adverse legal effect on a person may be taken solely based on the output of the remote biometric identification system.',\n",
       " '(21a) In order to carry out their tasks in accordance with the requirements set out in this Regulation as well as in national rules, the relevant market surveillance authority and the national data protection authority should be notified of each use of the ‘real-time biometric identification system’. National market surveillance authorities and the national data protection authorities that have been notified should submit to the Commission an annual report on the use of ‘real-time biometric identification systems’. (22) Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this Regulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this Regulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State in question has decided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its detailed rules of national law. Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to provide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of some of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation. These national rules should be notified to the Commission at the latest 30 days following their adoption. (23) The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should only be possible in as far as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In this context, this Regulation is not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 of Directive 2016/680. However, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation.',\n",
       " 'Such use for purposes other than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect to it. (24) Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement as regulated by this Regulation, should continue to comply with all requirements resulting from Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. For purposes other than law enforcement, Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 prohibit the processing of biometric data subject to limited exceptions as provided in those articles. In application of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the use of remote biometric identification for purposes other than law enforcement has already been subject to prohibition decisions by national data protection authorities. (25) In accordance with Article 6a of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, as annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Ireland is not bound by the rules laid down in Article 5(1), point (d), (2), (3), (3a), (4) and (5), Article 5(1)(ba) to the extent it applies to the use of biometric categorisation systems for activities in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Article 5(1)(da) to the extent it applies to the use of AI systems covered by that provision and Article 29(6a) of this Regulation adopted on the basis of Article 16 of the TFEU which relate to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU, where Ireland is not bound by the rules governing the forms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters or police cooperation which require compliance with the provisions laid down on the basis of Article 16 of the TFEU.',\n",
       " '(26) In accordance with Articles 2 and 2a of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and TFEU, Denmark is not bound by rules laid down in Article 5(1), point (d), (2), (3), (3a), (4) and (5), Article 5(1)(ba) to the extent it applies to the use of biometric categorisation systems for activities in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Article 5(1)(da) to the extent it applies to the use of AI systems covered by that provision and Article 29(6a) of this Regulation adopted on the basis of Article 16 of the TFEU, or subject to their application, which relate to the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU. (26a) In line with the presumption of innocence, natural persons in the EU should always be judged on their actual behaviour. Natural persons should never be judged on AI-predicted behaviour based solely on their profiling, personality traits or characteristics, such as nationality, place of birth, place of residence, number of children, debt, their type of car, without a reasonable suspicion of that person being involved in a criminal activity based on objective verifiable facts and without human assessment thereof. Therefore, risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess the risk of them offending or for predicting the occurrence of an actual or potential criminal offence solely based on the profiling of a natural person or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics should be prohibited. In any case, this prohibition does not refer to nor touch upon risk analytics that are not based on the profiling of individuals or on the personality traits and characteristics of individuals, such as AI systems using risk analytics to assess the risk of financial fraud by undertakings based on suspicious transactions or risk analytic tools to predict the likelihood of localisation of narcotics or illicit goods by customs authorities, for example based on known trafficking routes. (26b) The placing on the market, putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage should be prohibited, as this practice adds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross violations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.',\n",
       " '(26c) There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or infer emotions, particularly as expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures and situations, and even within a single individual. Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalizability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the imbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive nature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, putting into service, or use of AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and education should be prohibited. This prohibition should not cover AI systems placed on the market strictly for medical or safety reasons, such as systems intended for therapeutical use. (26d) Practices that are prohibited by Union legislation, including data protection law, non- discrimination law, consumer protection law, and competition law, should not be affected by this Regulation. (27) High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and protected by Union law. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C/2022/3637) the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation, such as Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on Medical Devices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on In Vitro Diagnostic Devices or Directive 2006/42/EC on Machinery, may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation.',\n",
       " 'To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade, if any. (28) AI systems could have an adverse impact to health and safety of persons, in particular when such systems operate as safety components of products. Consistently with the objectives of Union harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in the internal market and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their way into the market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product as a whole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and mitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of manufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and performs their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the stakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics systems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate. (28a) The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights protected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as high- risk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and of association, and non-discrimination, right to education consumer protection, workers’ rights, rights of persons with disabilities, gender equality, intellectual property rights, right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, right of defence and the presumption of innocence, right to good administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight that children have specific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the EU Charter and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (further elaborated in the UNCRC General Comment No.',\n",
       " '25 as regards the digital environment), both of which require consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection and care as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of environmental protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies should also be considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can cause, including in relation to the health and safety of persons. (29) As regards high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products or systems, or which are themselves products or systems falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council10, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council11, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council12, Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council13, Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council14, Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council15, Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council16,  and Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council17, it is appropriate to amend those acts to ensure that the Commission takes into account, on the basis of the technical and regulatory specificities of each sector, and without interfering with existing governance, conformity assessment and enforcement mechanisms and authorities established therein, the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems laid down in this Regulation when adopting any relevant future delegated or implementing acts on the basis of those acts. (30) As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this Regulation if the product in question undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a third-party conformity assessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation legislation. In particular, such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure equipment, recreational craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning gaseous fuels, medical devices, and in vitro diagnostic medical devices.',\n",
       " '(31) The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not necessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is considered ‘high-risk’ under the criteria established in the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is notably the case for Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council18 and  Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council19, where a third- party conformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products. (32) As regards stand-alone AI systems, meaning high-risk AI systems other than those that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of specifically pre-defined areas specified in the Regulation. The identification of those systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be empowered to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of technological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems. (32a) It is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems referred to pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk of harm to the legal interests protected under those areas, because they do not materially influence the decision-making or do not harm those interests substantially. For the purpose of this Regulation an AI system not materially influencing the outcome of decision-making should be understood as an AI system that does not impact the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human or automated. This could be the case if one or more of the following conditions are fulfilled. The first criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured data into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications.',\n",
       " 'These tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only limited risks which are not increased through the use in a context listed in Annex III. The second criterion should be that the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity that may be relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III. Considering these characteristics, the AI system only provides an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. For example, this criterion would apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the language used in previously drafted documents, for instance in relation to professional  tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. The third criterion should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered because the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment which it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI systems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can be used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern so as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth criterion should be that the AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the use case listed in Annex III, thus making the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing a risk for the assessment to follow. For example, this criterion covers smart solutions for file handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech processing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of initial documents. In any case, AI systems referred to in Annex III should be considered to pose significant risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 3(4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Article 3(5) of Regulation 2018/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk on the basis of the aforementioned criteria should draw up documentation of the assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service and should provide this documentation to national competent authorities upon request. Such provider should be obliged to register the system in the EU database established under this Regulation.',\n",
       " 'With a view to provide further guidance for the practical implementation of the criteria under which AI systems referred to in Annex III are exceptionally not high-risk, the Commission should, after consulting the AI Board, provide guidelines specifying this practical implementation completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and non-high risk use cases of AI systems. (33a) As biometric data constitutes a special category of sensitive personal data, it is appropriate to classify as high-risk several critical use-cases of biometric systems, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law. Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. This is particularly relevant when it comes to age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. Therefore, remote biometric identification systems should be classified as high-risk in view of the risks that they pose. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having secure access to premises. In addition, AI systems intended to be used for biometric categorisation according to sensitive attributes or characteristics protected under Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 based on biometric data, in so far as these are not prohibited under this Regulation, and emotion recognition systems that are not prohibited under this Regulation, should be classified as high-risk. Biometric systems which are intended to be used solely for the purpose of enabling cybersecurity and personal data protection measures should not be considered as high-risk systems. (34) As regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is appropriate to classify as high-risk the AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of critical digital infrastructure as listed in Annex I point 8 of the Directive on the resilience of critical entities, road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and health of persons at large scale and lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct of social and economic activities. Safety components of critical infrastructure, including critical digital infrastructure, are systems used to directly protect the physical integrity of critical infrastructure or health and safety of persons and property but which are not necessary in order for the system to function.',\n",
       " 'Failure or malfunctioning of such components might directly lead to risks to the physical integrity of critical infrastructure and thus to risks to health and safety of persons and property. Components intended to be used solely for cybersecurity purposes should not qualify as safety components. Examples of safety components of such critical infrastructure may include systems for monitoring water pressure or fire alarm controlling systems in cloud computing centres. (35) Deployment of AI systems in education is important to promote high-quality digital education and training and to allow all learners and teachers to acquire and share the necessary digital skills and competences, including media literacy, and critical thinking, to take an active part in the economy, society, and in democratic processes. However, AI systems used in education or vocational training, notably for determining access or admission, for assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or programmes at all levels, for evaluating learning outcomes of persons, for assessing the appropriate level of education for an individual and materially influencing the level of education and training that individuals will receive or be able to access or for monitoring and detecting prohibited behaviour of students during tests should be classified as high-risk AI systems, since they may determine the educational and professional course of a person’s life and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood. When improperly designed and used, such systems can be particularly intrusive and may violate the right to education and training as well as the right not to be discriminated against and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation. (36) AI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self-employment, notably for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions affecting terms of the work related relationship promotion and termination of work-related contractual relationships for allocating tasks based on individual behaviour, personal traits or characteristics and for monitoring or evaluation of persons in work-related contractual relationships, should also be classified as high-risk, since those systems may appreciably impact future career prospects, livelihoods of these persons and workers’ rights. Relevant work-related contractual relationships should meaningfully involve employees and persons providing services through platforms as referred to in the Commission Work Programme 2021. Throughout the recruitment process and in the evaluation, promotion, or retention of persons in work-related contractual relationships, such systems may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation.',\n",
       " 'AI systems used to monitor the performance and behaviour of these persons may also undermine their fundamental rights to data protection and privacy. (37) Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to and enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve one’s standard of living. In particular, natural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services from public authorities namely healthcare services, social security benefits, social services providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age and loss of employment and social and housing assistance, are typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services should be granted, denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, including whether beneficiaries are legitimately entitled to such benefits or services, those systems may have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human dignity or an effective remedy and should therefore be classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, this Regulation should not hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration, which would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural persons. In addition, AI systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural persons should be classified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons’ access to financial resources or essential services such as housing, electricity, and telecommunication services. AI systems used for this purpose may lead to discrimination of persons or groups and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example based on racial or ethnic origins, gender, disabilities, age, sexual orientation, or create new forms of discriminatory impacts. However, AI systems provided for by Union law for the purpose of detecting fraud in the offering of financial services and for prudential purposes to calculate credit institutions’ and insurances undertakings’ capital requirements should not be considered as high-risk under this Regulation. Moreover, AI systems intended to be used for risk assessment and pricing in relation to natural persons for health and life insurance can also have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood and if not duly designed, developed and used, can infringe their fundamental rights and can lead to serious consequences for people’s life and health, including financial exclusion and discrimination.',\n",
       " 'Finally, AI systems used to evaluate and classify emergency calls by natural persons or to dispatch or establish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services, including by police, firefighters and medical aid, as well as of emergency healthcare patient triage systems, should also be classified as high-risk since they make decisions in very critical situations for the life and health of persons and their property. (38) Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the AI system is not trained with high quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems intended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and ensure accountability and effective redress. In view of the nature of the activities in question and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI systems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of law enforcement authorities or by Union agencies, offices or bodies in support of law enforcement authorities for assessing the risk of a natural person to become a victim of criminal offences, as polygraphs and similar tools , for the evaluation of the reliability of evidence in in the course of investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and, insofar not prohibited under this regulation, for assessing the risk of a natural person of offending or reoffending not solely based on profiling of natural persons nor based on assessing personality traits and characteristics or past criminal behaviour of natural persons or groups, for profiling in the course of detection, investigation or prosecution of criminal offences,.',\n",
       " 'AI systems specifically intended to be used for administrative proceedings by tax and customs authorities as well as by financial intelligence units carrying out administrative tasks analysing information pursuant to Union anti-money laundering legislation should not be classified as high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. The use of AI tools by law enforcement and authorities should not become a factor of inequality, or exclusion. The impact of the use of AI tools on the defence rights of suspects should not be ignored, notably the difficulty in obtaining meaningful information on the functioning of these systems and the consequent difficulty in challenging their results in court, in particular by individuals under investigation. (39) AI systems used in migration, asylum and border control management affect people who are often in particularly vulnerable position and who are dependent on the outcome of the actions of the competent public authorities. The accuracy, non-discriminatory nature and transparency of the AI systems used in those contexts are therefore particularly important to guarantee the respect of the fundamental rights of the affected persons, notably their rights to free movement, non-discrimination, protection of private life and personal data, international protection and good administration. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of competent public authorities or by Union agencies, offices or bodies charged with tasks in the fields of migration, asylum and border control management as polygraphs and similar tools, for assessing certain risks posed by natural persons entering the territory of a Member State or applying for visa or asylum, for assisting competent public authorities for the examination, including related assessment of the reliability of evidence, of applications for asylum, visa and residence permits and associated complaints with regard to the objective to establish the eligibility of the natural persons applying for a status, for the purpose of detecting, recognising or identifying natural persons in the context of migration, asylum and border control management with the exception of travel documents. AI systems in the area of migration, asylum and border control management covered by this Regulation should comply with the relevant procedural requirements set by the Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council20, the Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council21 and other relevant legislation.',\n",
       " 'The use of AI systems in migration, asylum and border control management should in no circumstances be used by Member States or Union institutions, agencies or bodies as a means to circumvent their international obligations under the Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the Protocol of 31 January 1967, nor should they be used to in any way infringe on the principle of non-refoulement, or deny safe and effective legal avenues into the territory of the Union, including the right to international protection. (40) Certain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes should be classified as high-risk, considering their potentially significant impact on democracy, rule of law, individual freedoms as well as the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and opacity, it is appropriate to qualify as high-risk AI systems intended to be used by a judicial authority or on its behalf to assist judicial authorities in researching and interpreting facts and the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts. AI systems intended to be used by  alternative dispute resolution bodies for those purposes should also be considered high-risk when the outcomes of the alternative dispute resolution proceedings produce legal effects for the parties. The use of artificial intelligence tools can support the decision-making power of judges or judicial independence, but should not replace it, as the final decision- making must remain a human-driven activity and decision. Such qualification should not extend, however, to AI systems intended for purely ancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in individual cases, such as anonymisation or pseudonymisation of judicial decisions, documents or data, communication between personnel, administrative tasks. (40a) Without prejudice to the rules provided for in [Regulation xxx on the transparency and targeting of political advertising], and in order to address the risks of undue external interference to the right to vote enshrined in Article 39 of the Charter, and of adverse effects on democracy, and the rule of law, AI systems intended to be used to influence the outcome of an election or referendum or the voting behaviour of natural persons in the exercise of their vote in elections or referenda should be classified as high-risk AI systems with the exception of AI systems whose output natural persons are not directly exposed to, such as tools used to organise, optimise and structure political campaigns from an administrative and logistical point of view.',\n",
       " '(41) The fact that an AI system is classified as a high-risk AI system under this Regulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system is lawful under other acts of Union law or under national law compatible with Union law, such as on the protection of personal data, on the use of polygraphs and similar tools or other systems to detect the emotional state of natural persons. Any such use should continue to occur solely in accordance with the applicable requirements resulting from the Charter and from the applicable acts of secondary Union law and national law. This Regulation should not be understood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal data, including special categories of personal data, where relevant, unless it is specifically provided for otherwise in this Regulation. (42) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service and to ensure a high level of trustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should apply to high-risk AI systems, taking into account the intended purpose and the context of use of the AI system and according to the risk management system to be established by the provider. The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledge state of the art on artificial intelligence, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this Regulation. Following the New Legislative Framework approach, as clarified in Commission notice the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022 (C/2022/3637), the general rule is that several pieces of the EU legislation may have to be taken into consideration for one product, since the making available or putting into service can only take place when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. Hazards of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects than the existing Union harmonisation acts and therefore the requirements of this Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation acts. For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the relevant Union harmonised legislation, as this sectoral legislation does not deal with risks specific to AI systems. This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative acts.',\n",
       " 'To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative burden or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, should have a flexibility on operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more artificial intelligence systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonised legislation in a best way. This flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required under the existing Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A. This however should not in any way undermine the obligation of the provider to comply with all the applicable requirements. (42a) The risk management system should consist of a continuous, iterative process that is planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system. This process should be aimed at identifying and mitigating the relevant risks of artificial intelligence systems on health, safety and fundamental rights. The risk management system should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its continuing effectiveness, as well as justification and documentation of any significant decisions and actions taken subject to this Regulation. This process should ensure that the provider identifies risks or adverse impacts and implements mitigation measures for the known and reasonably foreseeable risks of artificial intelligence systems to the health, safety and fundamental rights in light of its intended purpose and reasonably foreseeable misuse, including the possible risks arising from the interaction between the AI system and the environment within which it operates. The risk management system should adopt the most appropriate risk management measures in the light of the state of the art in AI. When identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made and, when relevant, involve experts and external stakeholders. In identifying reasonably foreseeable misuse of high-risk AI systems the provider should cover uses of the AI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in the instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily predictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of the particular AI system. Any known or foreseeable circumstances, related to the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights should be included in the instructions for use provided by the provider.',\n",
       " 'This is to ensure that the deployer is aware and takes them into account when using the high-risk AI system. Identifying and implementing risk mitigation measures for foreseeable misuse under this Regulation should not require specific additional training measures for the high-risk AI system by the provider to address them. The providers however are encouraged to consider such additional training measures to mitigate reasonable foreseeable misuses as necessary and appropriate. (43) Requirements should apply to high-risk AI systems as regards risk management, the quality and relevance of data sets used, technical documentation and record-keeping, transparency and the provision of information to deployers, human oversight, and robustness, accuracy and cybersecurity. Those requirements are necessary to effectively mitigate the risks for health, safety and fundamental rights, and no other less trade restrictive measures are reasonably available, thus avoiding unjustified restrictions to trade. (44) High quality data and access to high quality data plays a vital role in providing structure and in ensuring the performance of many AI systems, especially when techniques involving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high-risk AI system performs as intended and safely and it does not become a source of discrimination prohibited by Union law. High quality datasets for training, validation and testing require the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. Datasets for training, validation and testing, including the labels, should be relevant, sufficiently representative, and to the best extent possible free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose of the system. In order to facilitate compliance with EU data protection law, such as Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data governance and management practices should include, in the case of personal data, transparency about the original purpose of the data collection, The datasets should also have the appropriate statistical properties, including as regards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI system is intended to be used, with specific attention to the mitigation of possible biases in the datasets, that are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, negatively impact fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future operations (‘feedback loops’). Biases can for example be inherent in underlying datasets, especially when historical data is being used, or generated when the systems are implemented in real world settings.',\n",
       " 'Results provided by AI systems could be influenced by such inherent biases that are inclined to gradually increase and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing discrimination, in particular for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups including racial or ethnic groups. The requirement for the datasets to be to the best extent possible complete and free of errors should not affect the use of privacy-preserving techniques in the context of the development and testing of AI systems. In particular, datasets should take into account, to the extent required by their intended purpose, the features, characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual, behavioural or functional setting which the AI system is intended to be used. The requirements related to data governance can be complied with by having recourse to third parties that offer certified compliance services including verification of data governance, data set integrity, and data training, validation and testing practices, as far as compliance with the data requirements of this Regulation are ensured. (45) For the development and assessment of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as providers, notified bodies and other relevant entities, such as digital innovation hubs, testing experimentation facilities and researchers, should be able to access and use high quality datasets within their respective fields of activities which are related to this Regulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the facilitation of data sharing between businesses and with government in the public interest will be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable and non-discriminatory access to high quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For example, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and the training of artificial intelligence algorithms on those datasets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy manner, and with an appropriate institutional governance. Relevant competent authorities, including sectoral ones, providing or supporting the access to data may also support the provision of high-quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. (45a) The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout the entire lifecycle of the AI system. In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default, as set out in Union data protection law, are applicable when personal data are processed.',\n",
       " 'Measures taken by providers to ensure compliance with those principles may include not only anonymisation and encryption, but also the use of technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allows training of AI systems without the transmission between parties or copying of the raw or structured data themselves, without prejudice to the requirements on data governance provided for in this Regulation. (44c) In order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from the bias in AI systems, the providers should, exceptionally, to the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purposes of ensuring bias detection and correction in relation to the high- risk AI systems, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and following the application of all applicable conditions laid down under this Regulation in addition to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725,be able to process also special categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest within the meaning of Article 9(2)(g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(2)g) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. (46) Having comprehensible information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed and how they perform throughout their lifetime is essential to enable traceability of those systems, verify compliance with the requirements under this Regulation, as well as monitoring of their operations and post market monitoring. This requires keeping records and the availability of a technical documentation, containing information which is necessary to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements and facilitate post market monitoring. Such information should include the general characteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training, testing and validation processes used as well as documentation on the relevant risk management system and drawn in a clear and comprehensive form. The technical documentation should be kept up to date, appropriately throughout the lifetime of the AI system. Furthermore, high risk AI systems should technically allow for automatic recording of events (logs) over the duration of the lifetime of the system. (47) To address concerns related to opacity and complexity of certain AI systems and help deployers to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation, transparency should be required for high-risk AI systems before they are placed on the market or put it into service. High- risk AI systems should be designed in a manner to enable deployers to understand how the AI system works, evaluate its functionality, and comprehend its strengths and limitations.',\n",
       " 'High-risk AI systems should be accompanied by appropriate information in the form of instructions of use. Such information should include the characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance of the AI system. These would cover information on possible known and foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high-risk AI system, including deployer action that may influence system behaviour and performance, under which the AI system can lead to risks to health, safety, and fundamental rights, on the changes that have been pre-determined and assessed for conformity by the provider and on the relevant human oversight measures, including the measures to facilitate the interpretation of the outputs of the AI system by the deployers. Transparency, including the accompanying instructions for use, should assist deployers in the use of the system and support informed decision making by them. Among others, deployers should be in a better position to make the correct choice of the system they intend to use in the light of the obligations applicable to them, be educated about the intended and precluded uses, and use the AI system correctly and as appropriate. In order to enhance legibility and accessibility of the information included in the instructions of use, where appropriate, illustrative examples, for instance on the limitations and on the intended and precluded uses of the AI system, should be included. Providers should ensure that all documentation, including the instructions for use, contains meaningful, comprehensive, accessible and understandable information, taking into account the needs and foreseeable knowledge of the target deployers. Instructions for use should be made available in a language which can be easily understood by target deployers, as determined by the Member State concerned. (48) High-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural persons can oversee their functioning, ensure that they are used as intended and that their impacts are addressed over the system’s lifecycle. For this purpose, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on the market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training and authority to carry out that role.',\n",
       " 'It is also essential, as appropriate, to ensure that high-risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and inform a natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed decisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, or stop the system if it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant consequences for persons in case of incorrect matches by certain biometric identification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human oversight requirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons. Those persons could be from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the system. This requirement should not pose unnecessary burden or delays and it could be sufficient that the separate verifications by the different persons are automatically recorded in the logs generated by the system. Given the specificities of the areas of law enforcement, migration, border control and asylum, this requirement should not apply in cases where Union or national law considers the application of this requirement to be disproportionate. (49) High-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity, in the light of their intended purpose and in accordance with the generally acknowledged state of the art. The Commission and relevant organisations and stakeholders are encouraged to take due consideration of mitigation of risks and negative impacts of the AI system. The expected level of performance metrics should be declared in the accompanying instructions of use. Providers are urged to communicate this information to deployers in a clear and easily understandable way, free of misunderstandings or misleading statements. The EU legislation on legal metrology, including on Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) and Non-automatic weighing instruments (NAWI) Directive, aims to ensure the accuracy of measurements and to help the transparency and fairness of commercial transactions. In this context, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders and organisation, such as metrology and benchmarking authorities, the Commission should encourage, as appropriate, the development of benchmarks and measurement methodologies for AI systems. In doing so, the Commission should take note and collaborate with international partners working on metrology and relevant measurement indicators relating to Artificial Intelligence. (50) The technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.',\n",
       " 'errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and organisational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, for example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or minimize harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour. Those technical solution may include for instance mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation (fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place outside certain predetermined boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system. (51) Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e. data poisoning) or trained models (e. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security controls, should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure. (51a) Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this Regulation, high-risk AI systems which fall within the scope of the Regulation 2022/0272, in accordance with Article 8 of the Regulation 2022/0272 may demonstrate compliance with the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation by fulfilling the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 10 and Annex I of the Regulation 2022/0272. When high-risk AI systems fulfil the essential requirements of Regulation 2022/0272, they should be deemed compliant with the cybersecurity requirements set out in this Regulation in so far as the achievement of those requirements is demonstrated in the EU declaration of conformity or parts thereof issued under Regulation 2022/0272. For this purpose, the assessment of the cybersecurity risks, associated to a product with digital elements classified as high-risk AI system according to this Regulation, carried out under Regulation 2022/0272, should consider risks to the cyber resilience of an AI system as regards attempts by unauthorised third parties to alter its use, behaviour or performance, including AI specific vulnerabilities such as data poisoning or adversarial attacks, as well as, as relevant, risks to fundamental rights as required by this Regulation.',\n",
       " 'The conformity assessment procedure provided by this Regulation should apply in relation to the essential cybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements covered by Regulation 2022/0272 and classified as a high-risk AI system under this Regulation. However, this rule should not result in reducing the necessary level of assurance for critical products with digital elements covered by Regulation 2022/0272. Therefore, by way of derogation from this rule, high-risk AI systems that fall within the scope of this Regulation and are also qualified as important and critical products with digital elements pursuant to Regulation 2022/0272 and to which the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to in Annex VI of this Regulation applies, are subject to the conformity assessment provisions of Regulation 2022/0272 insofar as the essential cybersecurity requirements of Regulation 2022/0272 are concerned. In this case, for all the other aspects covered by this Regulation the respective provisions on conformity assessment based on internal control set out in Annex VI of this Regulation should apply. Building on the knowledge and expertise of ENISA on the cybersecurity policy and tasks assigned to ENISA under the Regulation 2019/1020 the European Commission should cooperate with ENISA on issues related to cybersecurity of AI systems. (52) As part of Union harmonisation legislation, rules applicable to the placing on the market, putting into service and use of high-risk AI systems should be laid down consistently with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council22 setting out the requirements for accreditation and the market surveillance of products, Decision No  768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council23 on a common framework for the marketing of products and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council24 on market surveillance and compliance of products (‘New Legislative Framework for the marketing of products’). (53) It is appropriate that a specific natural or legal person, defined as the provider, takes the responsibility for the placing on the market or putting into service of a high-risk AI system, regardless of whether that natural or legal person is the person who designed or developed the system.',\n",
       " '(53a) As signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), the Union and the Member States are legally obliged to protect persons with disabilities from discrimination and promote their equality, to ensure that persons with disabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to information and communications technologies and systems, and to ensure respect for privacy for persons with disabilities. Given the growing importance and use of AI systems, the application of universal design principles to all new technologies and services should ensure full and equal access for everyone potentially affected by or using AI technologies, including persons with disabilities, in a way that takes full account of their inherent dignity and diversity. It is therefore essential that Providers ensure full compliance with accessibility requirements, including Directive (EU) 2016/2102 and Directive (EU) 2019/882. Providers should ensure compliance with these requirements by design. Therefore, the necessary measures should be integrated as much as possible into the design of the high-risk AI system. (54) The provider should establish a sound quality management system, ensure the accomplishment of the required conformity assessment procedure, draw up the relevant documentation and establish a robust post-market monitoring system. Providers of high- risk AI systems that are subject to obligations regarding quality management systems under relevant sectorial Union law should have the possibility to include the elements of the quality management system provided for in this Regulation as part of the existing quality management system provided for in that other sectorial Union legislation. The  complementarity between this Regulation and existing sectorial Union law should also be taken into account in future standardization activities or guidance adopted by the Commission. Public authorities which put into service high-risk AI systems for their own use may adopt and implement the rules for the quality management system as part of the quality management system adopted at a national or regional level, as appropriate, taking into account the specificities of the sector and the competences and organisation of the public authority in question. (56) To enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level-playing field for operators, and taking into account the different forms of making available of digital products, it is important to ensure that, under all circumstances, a person established in the Union can provide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance of an AI system. Therefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, providers established outside the Union shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative established in the Union.',\n",
       " 'This authorised representative plays a pivotal role in ensuring the compliance of the high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the Union by those providers who are not established in the Union and in serving as their contact person established in the Union. (56a) In the light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI systems and in line with New Legislative Framework principles, it is essential to ensure legal certainty and facilitate the compliance with this Regulation. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the role and the specific obligations of relevant operators along the value chain, such as importers and distributors who may contribute to the development of AI systems. In certain situations those operators could act in more than one role at the same time and should therefore fulfil cumulatively all relevant obligations associated with those roles. For example, an operator could act as a distributor and an importer at the same time. (57) To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party should be considered a provider of a high-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations. This would be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual arrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise, or if that party make a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has already been placed on the market or has already been put into service and in a way that it remains a high-risk AI system in accordance with Article 6, or if it modifies the intended purpose of an AI system, including a general purpose AI system, which has not been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into service, in a way that the AI system becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance with Article 6. These provisions should apply without prejudice to more specific provisions established in certain New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation with which this Regulation should apply jointly. For example, Article 16, paragraph 2 of Regulation 745/2017, establishing that certain changes should not be considered modifications of a device that could affect its compliance with the applicable requirements, should continue to apply to high-risk AI systems that are medical devices within the meaning of that Regulation. (57a) General purpose AI systems may be used as high-risk AI systems by themselves or be components of other high risk AI systems.',\n",
       " 'Therefore, due to their particular nature and in order to ensure a fair sharing of responsibilities along the AI value chain, the providers of such systems should, irrespective of whether they may be used as high-risk AI systems as such by other providers or as components of high-risk AI systems and unless provided otherwise under this Regulation, closely cooperate with the providers of the respective high-risk AI systems to enable their compliance with the relevant obligations under this Regulation and with the competent authorities established under this Regulation. (57b) Where, under the conditions laid down in this Regulation, the provider that initially placed the AI system on the market or put it into service should no longer be considered the provider for the purposes of this Regulation, and when that provider has not expressly excluded the change of the AI system into a high-risk AI system, the former provider should nonetheless closely cooperate and make available the necessary information and provide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance that are required for the fulfilment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in particular regarding the compliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI systems. (57c) In addition, where a high-risk AI system that is a safety component of a product which is covered by a relevant New Legislative Framework sectorial legislation is not placed on the market or put into service independently from the product, the product manufacturer as defined under the relevant New Legislative Framework legislation should comply with the obligations of the provider established in this Regulation and notably ensure that the AI system embedded in the final product complies with the requirements of this Regulation. (57d) Within the AI value chain multiple parties often supply AI systems, tools and services but also components or processes that are incorporated by the provider into the AI system with various objectives, including the model training, model retraining, model testing and evaluation, integration into software, or other aspects of model development. These parties have an important role in the value chain towards the provider of the high-risk AI system into which their AI systems, tools, services, components or processes are integrated, and should provide by written agreement this provider with the necessary information, capabilities, technical access and other assistance based on the generally acknowledged state of the art, in order to enable the provider to fully comply with the obligations set out in this Regulation, without compromising their own intellectual property rights or trade secrets.',\n",
       " '(57e) Third parties making accessible to the public tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models, shall not be mandated to comply with requirements targeting the responsibilities along the AI value chain, in particular towards the provider that has used or integrated them, when those tools, services, processes, or AI components are made accessible under a free and open licence. Developers of free and open-source tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models should be encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the Union. (57f) The Commission could develop and recommend voluntary model contractual terms between providers of high-risk AI systems and third parties that supply tools, services, components or processes that are used or integrated in high-risk AI systems, to facilitate the cooperation along the value chain. When developing voluntary model contractual terms, the Commission should also take into account possible contractual requirements applicable in specific sectors or business cases. (58) Given the nature of AI systems and the risks to safety and fundamental rights possibly associated with their use, including as regards the need to ensure proper monitoring of the performance of an AI system in a real-life setting, it is appropriate to set specific responsibilities for deployers. Deployers should in particular take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure they use high-risk AI systems in accordance with the instructions of use and certain other obligations should be provided for with regard to monitoring of the functioning of the AI systems and with regard to record-keeping, as appropriate. Furthermore, deployers should ensure that the persons assigned to implement the instructions for use and human oversight as set out in this Regulation have the necessary competence, in particular an adequate level of AI literacy, training and authority to properly fulfil those tasks. These obligations should be without prejudice to other deployer obligations in relation to high-risk AI systems under Union or national law. (58b) This Regulation is without prejudice to obligations for employers to inform or to inform and consult workers or their representatives under Union or national law and practice, including directive 2002/14/EC on a general framework for informing and consulting employees, on decisions to put into service or use AI systems.',\n",
       " 'It remains necessary to ensure information of workers and their representatives on the planned deployment of high-risk AI systems at the workplace in cases where the conditions for those information or information and consultation obligations in other legal instruments are not fulfilled. Moreover, such information right is ancillary and necessary to the objective of protecting fundamental rights that underlies this Regulation. Therefore, an information requirement to that effect should be laid down in this regulation, without affecting any existing rights of workers. (58b) Whilst risks related to AI systems can result from the way such systems are designed, risks can as well stem from how such AI systems are used. Deployers of high-risk AI system therefore play a critical role in ensuring that fundamental rights are protected, complementing the obligations of the provider when developing the AI system. Deployers are best placed to understand how the high-risk AI system will be used concretely and can therefore identify potential significant risks that were not foreseen in the development phase, due to a more precise knowledge of the context of use, the people or groups of people likely to be affected, including vulnerable groups. Deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III also play a critical role in informing natural persons and should, when they make decisions or assist in making decisions related to natural persons, where applicable, inform the natural persons that they are subject to the use of the high risk AI system. This information should include the intended purpose and the type of decisions it makes. The deployer should also inform the natural person about its right to an explanation provided under this Regulation. With regard to high-risk AI systems used for law enforcement purposes, this obligation should be implemented in accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2016/680. (58d) Any processing of biometric data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement needs to comply with Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, that allows such processing only where strictly necessary, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and where authorised by Union or Member State law. Such use, when authorized, also needs to respect the principles laid down in Article 4 paragraph 1 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 including lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage limitation.',\n",
       " '(58e) Without prejudice to applicable Union law, notably the GDPR and Directive (EU) 2016/680 (the Law Enforcement Directive), considering the intrusive nature of post remote biometric identification systems, the use of post remote biometric identification systems shall be subject to safeguards. Post biometric identification systems should always be used in a way that is proportionate, legitimate and strictly necessary, and thus targeted, in terms of the individuals to be identified, the location, temporal scope and based on a closed dataset of legally acquired video footage. In any case, post remote biometric identification systems should not be used in the framework of law enforcement to lead to indiscriminate surveillance. The conditions for post remote biometric identification should in any case not provide a basis to circumvent the conditions of the prohibition and strict exceptions for real time remote biometric identification. (58g) In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private operators providing public services and operators deploying certain high-risk AI system referred to in Annex III, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private operators providing such services of public nature are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the area of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in case of the materialisation of these risks. The impact assessment should apply to the first use of the high-risk AI system, and should be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be affected in the specific context of use. The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to impact the fundamental rights of these persons or groups.',\n",
       " 'While performing this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper assessment of impact, including but not limited to the information given by the provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in case of the materialization of these risks, including for example governance arrangements in that specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After performing this impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and designing measures to be taken in the case of materialization of the risks. The AI Office should develop a template for a questionnaire in order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers. (60a) The notion of general purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from the notion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self- supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General purpose AI models may be placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general purpose AI models and for general purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these models are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the obligations for the providers of general purpose AI models should apply once the general purpose AI models are placed on the market.',\n",
       " 'When the provider of a general purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be considered as being placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations foreseen for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole purpose of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is placed on the market. (60b) Whereas the generality of a model could, among other criteria, also be determined by a number of parameters, models with at least a billion of parameters and trained with a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale should be considered as displaying significant generality and competently performing a wide range of distinctive tasks. (60c) Large generative AI models are a typical example for a general-purpose AI model, given that they allow for flexible generation of content (such as in the form of text, audio, images or video) that can readily accommodate a wide range of distinctive tasks. (60d) When a general-purpose AI model is integrated into or forms part of an AI system, this system should be considered a general-purpose AI system when, due to this integration, this system has the capability to serve a variety of purposes. A general-purpose AI system can be used directly, or it may be integrated into other AI systems. (60e) Providers of general purpose AI models have a particular role and responsibility in the AI value chain, as the models they provide may form the basis for a range of downstream systems, often provided by downstream providers that necessitate a good understanding of the models and their capabilities, both to enable the integration of such models into their products, and to fulfil their obligations under this or other regulations. Therefore, proportionate transparency measures should be foreseen, including the drawing up and keeping up to date of documentation, and the provision of information on the general purpose AI model for its usage by the downstream providers.',\n",
       " 'Technical documentation should be prepared and kept up to date by the general purpose AI model provider for the purpose of making it available, upon request, to the AI Office and the national competent authorities. The minimal set of elements contained in such documentations should be outlined, respectively, in Annex (IXb) and Annex (IXa). The Commission should be enabled to amend the Annexes by delegated acts in the light of the evolving technological developments. (60i) Software and data, including models, released under a free and open-source licence that allows them to be openly shared and where users can freely access, use, modify and redistribute them or modified versions thereof, can contribute to research and innovation in the market and can provide significant growth opportunities for the Union economy. General purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences should be considered to ensure high levels of transparency and openness if their parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage are made publicly available. The licence should be considered free and open- source also when it allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software and data, including models under the condition that the original provider of the model is credited, the identical or comparable terms of distribution are respected. (60i+1) Free and open-source AI components covers the software and data, including models and general purpose AI models, tools, services or processes of an AI system. Free and open- source AI components can be provided through different channels, including their development on open repositories. For the purpose of this Regulation, AI components that are provided against a price or otherwise monetised, including through the provision of technical support or other services, including through a software platform, related to the AI component, or the use of personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, with the exception of transactions between micro enterprises, should not benefit from the exceptions provided to free and open source AI components. The fact of making AI components available through open repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetisation.',\n",
       " '(60f) The providers of general purpose AI models that are released under a free and open source license, and whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage, are made publicly available should be subject to exceptions as regards the transparency-related requirements imposed on general purpose AI models, unless they can be considered to present a systemic risk, in which case the circumstance that the model is transparent and accompanied by an open source license should not be considered a sufficient reason to exclude compliance with the obligations under this Regulation. In any case, given that the release of general purpose AI models under free and open source licence does not necessarily reveal substantial information on the dataset used for the training or fine-tuning of the model and on how thereby the respect of copyright law was ensured, the exception provided for general purpose AI models from compliance with the transparency-related requirements should not concern the obligation to produce a summary about the content used for model training and the obligation to put in place a policy to respect Union copyright law in particular to identify and respect the reservations of rights expressed pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790. (60i) General purpose models, in particular large generative models, capable of generating text, images, and other content, present unique innovation opportunities but also challenges to artists, authors, and other creators and the way their creative content is created, distributed, used and consumed. The development and training of such models require access to vast amounts of text, images, videos, and other data. Text and data mining techniques may be used extensively in this context for the retrieval and analysis of such content, which may be protected by copyright and related rights. Any use of copyright protected content requires the authorization of the rightholder concerned unless relevant copyright exceptions and limitations apply. Directive (EU) 2019/790 introduced exceptions and limitations allowing reproductions and extractions of works or other subject matter, for the purposes of text and data mining, under certain conditions. Under these rules, rightholders may choose to reserve their rights over their works or other subject matter to prevent text and data mining, unless this is done for the purposes of scientific research. Where the rights to opt out has been expressly reserved in an appropriate manner, providers of general-purpose AI models need to obtain an authorisation from rightholders if they want to carry out text and data mining over such works.',\n",
       " '(60j) Providers that place general purpose AI models on the EU market should ensure compliance with the relevant obligations in this Regulation. For this purpose, providers of general purpose AI models should put in place a policy to respect Union law on copyright and related rights, in particular to identify and respect the reservations of rights expressed by rightholders pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790. Any provider placing a general purpose AI model on the EU market should comply with this obligation, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the copyright-relevant acts underpinning the training of these general purpose AI models take place. This is necessary to ensure a level playing field among providers of general purpose AI models where no provider should be able to gain a competitive advantage in the EU market by applying lower copyright standards than those provided in the Union. (60k) In order to increase transparency on the data that is used in the pre-training and training of general purpose AI models, including text and data protected by copyright law, it is adequate that providers of such models draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary of the content used for training the general purpose model. While taking into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information, this summary should be generally comprehensive in its scope instead of technically detailed to facilitate parties with legitimate interests, including copyright holders, to exercise and enforce their rights under Union law, for example by listing the main data collections or sets that went into training the model, such as large private or public databases or data archives, and by providing a narrative explanation about other data sources used. It is appropriate for the AI Office to provide a template for the summary, which should be simple, effective, and allow the provider to provide the required summary in narrative form. (60ka) With regard to the obligations imposed on providers of general purpose AI models to put in place a policy to respect Union copyright law and make publicly available a summary of the content used for the training, the AI Office should monitor whether the provider has fulfilled those obligations without verifying or proceeding to a work-by-work assessment of the training data in terms of copyright compliance. This Regulation does not affect the enforcement of copyright rules as provided for under Union law.',\n",
       " '(60g) Compliance with the obligations foreseen for the providers of general purpose AI models should be commensurate and proportionate to the type of model provider, excluding the need for compliance for persons who develop or use models for non-professional or scientific research purposes, who should nevertheless be encouraged to voluntarily comply with these requirements. Without prejudice to Union Copyright law, compliance with these obligations should take due account of the size of the provider and allow simplified ways of compliance for SMEs including start-ups, that should not represent an excessive cost and not discourage the use of such models. In case of a modification or fine-tuning of a model, the obligations for providers should be limited to that modification or fine-tuning, for example by complementing the already existing technical documentation with information on the modifications, including new training data sources, as a means to comply with the value chain obligations provided in this Regulation. (60m) General purpose AI models could pose systemic risks which include, but are not limited to, any actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects in relation to major accidents, disruptions of critical sectors and serious consequences to public health and safety. any actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, public and economic security. the dissemination of illegal, false, or discriminatory content. Systemic risks should be understood to increase with model capabilities and model reach, can arise along the entire lifecycle of the model, and are influenced by conditions of misuse, model reliability, model fairness and model security, the degree of autonomy of the model, its access to tools, novel or combined modalities, release and distribution strategies, the potential to remove guardrails and other factors. In particular, international approaches have so far identified the need to devote attention to risks from potential intentional misuse or unintended issues of control relating to alignment with human intent. chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, such as the ways in which barriers to entry can be lowered, including for weapons development, design acquisition, or use. offensive cyber capabilities, such as the ways in vulnerability discovery, exploitation, or operational use can be enabled. the effects of interaction and tool use, including for example the capacity to control physical systems and interfere with critical infrastructure. risks from models of making copies of themselves or “self-replicating” or training other models. the ways in which models can give rise to harmful bias and discrimination with risks to individuals, communities or societies. the facilitation of disinformation or harming privacy with threats to democratic values and human rights.',\n",
       " 'risk that a particular event could lead to a chain reaction with considerable negative effects that could affect up to an entire city, an entire domain activity or an entire community. (60n) It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general purpose AI models as general purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI models should be considered to present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general purpose AI models means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood after its release on the market or when users interact with the model. According to the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount of compute used for the training of the general purpose AI model measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. The amount of compute used for training cumulates the compute used across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of FLOPs should be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take into taking into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold.',\n",
       " 'This decision should be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria set out in Annex YY, such as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and output modalities, its degree of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general- purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks. (60o) It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. A general purpose AI model that meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general purpose AI models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant in relation to the FLOP threshold because training of general purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, therefore, providers of general purpose AI models are able to know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of this notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that because of its specific characteristics, a general purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general purpose AI model with systemic risks. This information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. This is especially important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source, given that, after open-source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to implement. (60p) If the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general purpose AI model meets the requirements to classify as a general purpose model with systemic risk, which previously had either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to notify the Commission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so.',\n",
       " 'A system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of general-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as general purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of the AI Office. (60q) The providers of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, in addition to the obligations provided for providers of general purpose AI models, to obligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate level of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone model or embedded in an AI system or a product. To achieve these objectives, the Regulation should require providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in particular prior to its first placing on the market, including conducting and documenting adversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent external testing. In addition, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should continuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting in place risk management policies, such as accountability and governance processes, implementing post-market monitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire model’s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors across the AI value chain. (60r) Providers of general purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate possible systemic risks. If, despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a general purpose AI model that may present systemic risks, the development or use of the model causes a serious incident, the general purpose AI model provider should without undue delay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible corrective measures to the Commission and national competent authorities. Furthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. Cybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use of or attacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unsanctioned releases, circumvention of safety measures, and defence against cyberattacks, unauthorised access or model theft. This protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, algorithms, servers, and datasets, such as through operational security measures for information security, specific cybersecurity policies, adequate technical and established solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the relevant circumstances and the risks involved. (60s) The AI Office should encourage and facilitate the drawing up, review and adaptation of Codes of Practice, taking into account international approaches. All providers of general- purpose AI models could be invited to participate.',\n",
       " 'To ensure that the Codes of Practice reflect the state of the art and duly take into account a diverse set of perspectives, the AI Office should collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where appropriate, consult with civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders and experts, including the Scientific Panel, for the drawing up of the Codes. Codes of Practice should cover obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models and of general- purpose models presenting systemic risks. In addition, as regards systemic risks, Codes of Practice should help to establish a risk taxonomy of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, including their sources. Codes of practice should also be focused on specific risk assessment and mitigation measures. (60t) The Codes of Practice should represent a central tool for the proper compliance with the obligations foreseen under this Regulation for providers of general-purpose AI models. Providers should be able to rely on Codes of Practice to demonstrate compliance with the obligations. By means of implementing acts, the Commission may decide to approve a code of practice and give it a general validity within the Union, or, alternatively, to provide common rules for the implementation of the relevant obligations, if, by the time the Regulation becomes applicable, a Code of Practice cannot be finalised or is not deemed adequate by the AI Office. Once a harmonised standard is published and assessed as suitable to cover the relevant obligations by the AI Office, the compliance with a European harmonised standard should grant providers the presumption of conformity. Providers of general purpose AI models should furthermore be able to demonstrate compliance using alternative adequate means, if codes of practice or harmonized standards are not available, or they choose not to rely on those. (60u) This Regulation regulates AI systems and models by imposing certain requirements and obligations for relevant market actors that are placing them on the market, putting into service or use in the Union, thereby complementing obligations for providers of intermediary services that embed such systems or models into their services regulated by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. To the extent that such systems or models are embedded into designated very large online platforms or very large online search engines, they are subject to the risk management framework provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. Consequently, the corresponding obligations of the AI Act should be presumed to be fulfilled, unless significant systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 emerge and are identified in such models.',\n",
       " 'Within this framework, providers of very large online platforms and very large search engines are obliged to assess potential systemic risks stemming from the design, functioning and use of their services, including how the design of algorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, as well as systemic risks stemming from potential misuses. Those providers are also obliged to take appropriate mitigating measures in observance of fundamental rights. (60aa) Considering the quick pace of innovation and the technological evolution of digital services in scope of different instruments of Union law in particular having in mind the usage and the perception of their recipients, the AI systems subject to this Regulation may be provided as intermediary services or parts thereof within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, which should be interpreted in a technology-neutral manner. For example, AI systems may be used to provide online search engines, in particular, to the extent that an AI system such as an online chatbot performs searches of, in principle, all websites, then incorporates the results into its existing knowledge and uses the updated knowledge to generate a single output that combines different sources of information. (60v) Furthermore, obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including through disinformation. (61) Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to ensure compliance with this Regulation, in line with the state of the art, to promote innovation as well as competitiveness and growth in the single market. Compliance with harmonised standards as defined in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council25, which are normally expected to reflect the state of the art, should be a means for providers to demonstrate conformity with the requirements of this Regulation. A balanced representation of interests involving all relevant stakeholders in the development of standards, in particular SME’s, consumer organisations and environmental and social stakeholders in accordance with Article 5 and 6 of Regulation 1025/2012 should therefore be encouraged.',\n",
       " 'In order to facilitate compliance, the standardisation requests should be issued by the Commission without undue delay. When preparing the standardisation request, the Commission should consult the AI advisory Forum and the Board in order to  collect relevant expertise. However, in the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the Commission should be able to establish, via implementing acts, and after consultation of the AI Advisory forum, common specifications for certain requirements under this Regulation. The common specification should be an exceptional fall back solution to facilitate the provider’s obligation to comply with the requirements of this Regulation, when the standardisation request has not been accepted by any of the European standardisation organisations, or when the relevant harmonized standards insufficiently address fundamental rights concerns, or when the harmonised standards do not comply with the request, or when there are delays in the adoption of an appropriate harmonised standard. If such delay in the adoption of a harmonised standard is due to the technical complexity of the standard in question, this should be considered by the Commission before contemplating the establishment of common specifications. When developing common specifications, the Commission is encouraged to cooperate with international partners and international standardisation bodies. (61a) It is appropriate that, without prejudice to the use of harmonised standards and common specifications, providers of high-risk AI system that has been trained and tested on data reflecting the specific geographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within which the AI system is intended to be used, should be presumed to be in compliance with the respective measure provided for under the requirement on data governance set out in this Regulation. Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this Regulation, in line with Article 54(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council, high-risk AI systems that have been certified or for which a statement of conformity has been issued under a cybersecurity scheme pursuant to that Regulation and the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union should be presumed to be in compliance with the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation in so far as the cybersecurity certificate or statement of conformity or parts thereof cover the cybersecurity requirement of this Regulation This remains without prejudice to the voluntary nature of that cybersecurity scheme. (62) In order to ensure a high level of trustworthiness of high-risk AI systems, those systems should be subject to a conformity assessment prior to their placing on the market or putting into service.',\n",
       " '(63) It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any possible duplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by existing Union harmonisation legislation following the New Legislative Framework approach, the compliance of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be assessed as part of the conformity assessment already foreseen under that legislation. The applicability of the requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific logic, methodology or general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant specific New Legislative Framework legislation. (64) Given the complexity of high-risk AI systems and the risks that are associated to them, it is important to develop an adequate system of conformity assessment procedure for high risk AI systems involving notified bodies, so called third party conformity assessment. However, given the current experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field of product safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in an initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third-party conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to products. Therefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general rule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems intended to be used for biometrics. (65) In order to carry out third-party conformity assessments when so required, notified bodies should be notified under this Regulation by the national competent authorities, provided they are compliant with a set of requirements, notably on independence, competence, absence of conflicts of interests and suitable cybersecurity requirements. Notification of those bodies should be sent by national competent authorities to the Commission and the other Member States by means of the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission pursuant to Article R23 of Decision 768/2008. (65a) In line with Union commitments under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, it is adequate to facilitate the mutual recognition of conformity assessment results produced by competent conformity assessment bodies, independent of the territory in which they are established, provided that those conformity assessment bodies established under the law of a third country meet the applicable requirements of the Regulation and the Union has concluded an agreement to that extent. In this context, the Commission should actively explore possible international instruments for that purpose and in particular pursue the conclusion of mutual recognition agreements with third countries.',\n",
       " '(66) In line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification for products regulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate that whenever a change occurs which may affect the compliance of a high risk AI system with this Regulation (e. change of operating system or software architecture), or when the intended purpose of the system changes, that AI system should be considered a new AI system which should undergo a new conformity assessment. However, changes occurring to the algorithm and the performance of AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market or put into service (i. automatically adapting how functions are carried out) should not constitute a substantial modification, provided that those changes have been pre- determined by the provider and assessed at the moment of the conformity assessment. (67) High-risk AI systems should bear the CE marking to indicate their conformity with this Regulation so that they can move freely within the internal market. For high-risk AI systems embedded in a product, a physical CE marking should be affixed, and may be complemented by a digital CE marking. For high-risk AI systems only provided digitally, a digital CE marking should be used. Member States should not create unjustified obstacles to the placing on the market or putting into service of high-risk AI systems that comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and bear the CE marking. (68) Under certain conditions, rapid availability of innovative technologies may be crucial for health and safety of persons, the protection of the environment and climate change and for society as a whole. It is thus appropriate that under exceptional reasons of public security or protection of life and health of natural persons, environmental protection and the protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets, market surveillance authorities could authorise the placing on the market or putting into service of AI systems which have not undergone a conformity assessment. In a duly justified situations as provided under this regulations, law enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a specific high-risk AI system into service without the authorisation of the market surveillance authority, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use without undue delay.',\n",
       " '(69) In order to facilitate the work of the Commission and the Member States in the artificial intelligence field as well as to increase the transparency towards the public, providers of high-risk AI systems other than those related to products falling within the scope of relevant existing Union harmonisation legislation, as well as providers who consider that an AI system referred to in annex III is by derogation not high-risk, should be required to register themselves and information about their AI system in a EU database, to be established and managed by the Commission. Before using a high-risk AI system listed in Annex III, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities, agencies or bodies, shall register themselves in such database and select the system that they envisage to use. Other deployers should be entitled to do so voluntarily. This section of the database should be publicly accessible, free of charge, the information should be easily navigable, understandable and machine-readable. The database should also be user-friendly, for example by providing search functionalities, including through keywords, allowing the general public to find relevant information included in Annex VIII and on the areas of risk under Annex III to which the high-risk AI systems correspond. Any substantial modification of high-risk AI systems should also be registered in the EU database. For high risk AI systems in the area of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management, the registration obligations should be fulfilled in a secure non-public section of the database. Access to the secure non-public section should be strictly limited to the Commission as well as to market surveillance authorities with regard to their national section of that database. High risk AI systems in the area of critical infrastructure should only be registered at national level. The Commission should be the controller of the EU database, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council26. In order to ensure the full functionality of the database, when deployed, the procedure for setting the database should include the elaboration of functional specifications by the Commission and an independent audit report. The Commission should take into account cybersecurity and hazard-related risks when carrying out its tasks as data controller on the EU database. In order to maximise the availability and use of the database by the public, the database, including the information made available through it, should comply with requirements under the Directive 2019/882.',\n",
       " '(70) Certain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content may pose specific risks of impersonation or deception irrespective of whether they qualify as high-risk or not. In certain circumstances, the use of these systems should therefore be  subject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the requirements and obligations for high-risk AI systems and subject to targeted exceptions to take into account the special need of law enforcement. In particular, natural persons should be notified that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a natural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect taking into account the circumstances and the context of use. When implementing such obligation, the characteristics of individuals belonging to vulnerable groups due to their age or disability should be taken into account to the extent the AI system is intended to interact with those groups as well. Moreover, natural persons should be notified when they are exposed to systems that, by processing their biometric data, can identify or infer the emotions or intentions of those persons or assign them to specific categories. Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, tattoos, personal traits, ethnic origin, personal preferences and interests. Such information and notifications should be provided in accessible formats for persons with disabilities. (70a) A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic content that becomes increasingly hard for humans to distinguish from human-generated and authentic content. The wide availability and increasing capabilities of those systems have a significant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new risks of misinformation and manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer deception. In the light of those impacts, the fast technological pace and the need for new methods and techniques to trace origin of information, it is appropriate to require providers of those systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a machine readable format and detection that the output has been generated or manipulated by an AI system and not a human. Such techniques and methods should be sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, such as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving provenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other techniques, as may be appropriate.',\n",
       " 'When implementing this obligation, providers should also take into account the specificities and the limitations of the different types of content and the relevant technological and market developments in the field, as reflected in the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art. Such techniques and methods can be implemented at the level of the system or at the level of the model, including general-purpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation by the downstream provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is appropriate to envisage that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems performing primarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not substantially altering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof. (70b) Further to the technical solutions employed by the providers of the system, deployers , who use an AI system to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that appreciably resembles existing persons, places or events and would falsely appear to a person to be authentic (‘deep fakes’), should also clearly and distinguishably disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial intelligence output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin The compliance with this transparency obligation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system or its output impedes the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of the arts and sciences guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, in particular where the content is part of an evidently creative, satirical, artistic or fictional work or programme, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties. In those cases, the transparency obligation for deep fakes set out in this Regulation is limited to disclosure of the existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does not hamper the display or enjoyment of the work, including its normal exploitation and use, while maintaining the utility and quality of the work. In addition, it is also appropriate to envisage a similar disclosure obligation in relation to AI-generated or manipulated text to the extent it is published with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest unless the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial control and a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the publication of the content. (70c) To ensure consistent implementation, it is appropriate to empower the Commission to adopt implementing acts on the application of the provisions on the labelling and detection of artificially generated or manipulated content.',\n",
       " 'Without prejudice to the mandatory nature and full applicability of these obligations, the Commission may also encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level to facilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the detection and labelling of artificially generated or manipulated content, including to support practical arrangements for making, as appropriate, the detection mechanisms accessible and facilitating cooperation with other actors in the value chain, disseminating content or checking its authenticity and provenance to enable the public to effectively distinguish AI-generated content. (70d) The obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this Regulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are artificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search engines to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of content that has been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the actual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and electoral processes, including through disinformation. The requirement to label content generated by AI systems under this Regulation is without prejudice to the obligation in Article 16(6) of Regulation 2022/2065 for providers of hosting services to process notices on illegal content received pursuant to Article 16(1) and should not influence the assessment and the decision on the illegality of the specific content. That assessment should be performed solely with reference to the rules governing the legality of the content. (70e) The compliance with the transparency obligations for the AI systems coved by this Regulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system or its output is lawful under this Regulation or other Union and Member State law and should be without prejudice to other transparency obligations for deployers of AI systems laid down in Union or national law. (71) Artificial intelligence is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires regulatory oversight and a safe and controlled space for experimentation, while ensuring responsible innovation and integration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures. To ensure a legal framework that promotes innovation, is future-proof and resilient to disruption, Member States should ensure that their national competent authorities establish at least one artificial intelligence regulatory sandbox at national level to facilitate the development and testing of innovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on the market or otherwise put into service.',\n",
       " 'Member States could also fulfil this obligation through participating in already existing regulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly a sandbox with one or several Member States’ competent authorities, insofar as this participation provides equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member States. Regulatory sandboxes could be established in physical, digital or hybrid form and may accommodate physical as well as digital products. Establishing authorities should also ensure that the regulatory sandboxes have the adequate resources for their functioning, including financial and human resources. (72) The objectives of the AI regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and pre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI systems with this Regulation and other relevant Union and Member States legislation, to enhance legal certainty for innovators and the competent authorities’ oversight and understanding of the opportunities, emerging risks and the impacts of AI use, to facilitate regulatory learning for authorities and companies, including with a view to future adaptions of the legal framework, to support cooperation and the sharing of best practices with the authorities involved in the AI regulatory sandbox, and to accelerate access to markets, including by removing barriers for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including start-ups. Regulatory sandboxes should be widely available throughout the Union, and particular attention should be given to their accessibility for SMEs, including startups. The participation in the AI regulatory sandbox should focus on issues that raise legal uncertainty for providers and prospective providers to innovate, experiment with AI in the Union and contribute to evidence-based regulatory learning. The supervision of the AI systems in the AI regulatory sandbox should therefore cover their development, training, testing and validation before the systems are placed on the market or put into service, as well as the notion and occurrence of substantial modification that may require a new conformity assessment procedure. Any significant risks identified during the development and testing of such AI systems should result in adequate mitigation and, failing that, in the suspension of the development and testing process Where appropriate, national competent authorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes should cooperate with other relevant authorities, including those supervising the protection of fundamental rights,, and could allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI ecosystem such as national or European standardisation organisations, notified bodies, testing and experimentation facilities, research and experimentation labs, European Digital innovation hubs and relevant stakeholder and civil society organisations.',\n",
       " 'To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and economies of scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the regulatory sandboxes’ implementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant authorities involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. AI regulatory sandboxes established under this Regulation should be without prejudice to other legislation allowing for the establishment of other sandboxes aiming at ensuring compliance with legislation other that this Regulation. Where appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of those other regulatory sandboxes should consider the benefits of using those sandboxes also for the purpose of ensuring compliance of AI systems with this Regulation. Upon agreement between the national competent authorities and the participants in the AI regulatory sandbox, testing in real world conditions may also be operated and supervised in the framework of the AI regulatory sandbox. (72a) This Regulation should provide the legal basis for the providers and prospective providers in the AI regulatory sandbox to use personal data collected for other purposes for developing certain AI systems in the public interest within the AI regulatory sandbox, only under specified conditions, in line with Article 6(4) and 9(2)(g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and Article 5, 6 and 10 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, and without prejudice to Articles 4(2) and 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. All other obligations of data controllers and rights of data subjects under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 remain applicable. In particular, this Regulation should not provide a legal basis in the meaning of Article 22(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 24(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. Providers and prospective providers in the sandbox should ensure appropriate safeguards and cooperate with the competent authorities, including by following their guidance and acting expeditiously and in good faith to adequately mitigate any identified - significant risks to safety, health, and fundamental rights that may arise during the development, testing and experimentation in the sandbox. (72b) In order to accelerate the process of development and placing on the market of high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III, it is important that providers or prospective providers of such systems may also benefit from a specific regime for testing those systems in real world conditions, without participating in an AI regulatory sandbox.',\n",
       " 'However, in such cases and taking into account the possible consequences of such testing on individuals, it should be ensured that appropriate and sufficient guarantees and conditions are introduced by the Regulation for providers or prospective providers. Such guarantees should include, among others, requesting informed consent of natural persons to participate in testing in real world conditions, with the exception of law enforcement in cases where the seeking of informed consent would prevent the AI system from being tested. Consent of subjects to participate in such testing under this Regulation is distinct from and without prejudice to consent of data subjects for the processing of their personal data under the relevant data protection law. It is also important to minimise the risks and enable oversight by competent authorities and therefore require prospective providers to have a real-world testing plan submitted to competent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated sections in the EU-wide database subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the period for which the testing can be done and require additional safeguards for persons belonging to certain vulnerable groups as well as a written agreement defining the roles and responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by competent personnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to envisage additional safeguards to ensure that the predictions, recommendations or decisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and disregarded and that personal data is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to participate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the EU data protection law. As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage that data collected and processed for the purpose of the testing in real world conditions should only be transferred to third countries outside the Union provided appropriate and applicable safeguards under Union law are implemented, notably in accordance with bases for transfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non-personal data appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as the Data Governance Act and the Data Act. (72c) To ensure that Artificial Intelligence leads to socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, Member States are encouraged to support and promote research and development of AI solutions in support of socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, such as AI-based solutions to increase accessibility for persons with disabilities, tackle socio-economic inequalities, or meet environmental targets, by allocating sufficient resources, including public and Union funding, and, where appropriate and provided that the eligibility and selection criteria are fulfilled, considering in particular projects which pursue such objectives.',\n",
       " 'Such projects should be based on the principle of interdisciplinary cooperation between AI developers, experts on inequality and non- discrimination, accessibility, consumer, environmental, and digital rights, as well as academics. (73) In order to promote and protect innovation, it is important that the interests of SMEs, including start-ups, that are providers or deployers of AI systems are taken into particular account. To this objective, Member States should develop initiatives, which are targeted at those operators, including on, awareness raising and information communication. Member States shall provide SME’s, including start-ups, having a registered office or a branch in the Union, with priority access to the AI regulatory sandboxes provided that they fulfil the eligibility conditions and selection criteria and without precluding other providers and prospective providers to access the sandboxes provided the same conditions and criteria are fulfilled. Member States shall utilise existing channels and where appropriate, establish new dedicated channels for communication with SMEs, start-ups, deployers other innovators and, as appropriate, local public authorities, to support SMEs throughout their development path by providing guidance and responding to queries about the implementation of this Regulation. Where appropriate, these channels shall work together to create synergies and ensure homogeneity in their guidance to SMEs including start-ups and deployers. Additionally, Member States should facilitate the participation of SMEs and other relevant stakeholders in the standardisation development processes. Moreover, the specific interests and needs of SMEs including start-up providers should be taken into account when Notified Bodies set conformity assessment fees. The Commission should regularly assess the certification and compliance costs for SMEs including start-ups, through transparent consultations deployers and should work with Member States to lower such costs. For example, translation costs related to mandatory documentation and communication with authorities may constitute a significant cost for providers and other operators, notably those of a smaller scale. Member States should possibly ensure that one of the languages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers’ documentation and for communication with operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible number of cross-border deployers. In order to address the specific needs of SMEs including start-ups, the Commission should provide standardised templates for the areas covered by this Regulation upon request of the AI Board.',\n",
       " 'Additionally, the Commission should complement Member States’ efforts by providing a single information platform with easy-to-use information with regards to this Regulation for all providers and deployers, by organising appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about the obligations arising from this Regulation, and by evaluating and promoting the convergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems. Medium-sized enterprises which recently changed from the small to medium-size category within the meaning of the Annex to Recommendation 2003/361/EC (Article 16) should have access to these support measures, as these new medium-sized enterprises may sometimes lack the legal resources and training necessary to ensure proper understanding and compliance with provisions. (73a) In order to promote and protect innovation, the AI-on demand platform, all relevant EU funding programmes and projects, such as Digital Europe Programme, Horizon Europe, implemented by the Commission and the Member States at national or Union level should, as appropriate, contribute to the achievement of the objectives of this Regulation. (74) In particular, in order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of knowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers, notably SMEs, including start-ups, and notified bodies with their obligations under this Regulation, the AI-on demand platform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and the Testing and Experimentation Facilities established by the Commission and the Member States at national or EU level should contribute to the implementation of this Regulation. Within their respective mission and fields of competence, they may provide in particular technical and scientific support to providers and notified bodies. (74a) Moreover, in order to ensure proportionality considering the very small size of some operators regarding costs of innovation, it is appropriate to allow microenterprises to fulfil one of the most costly obligations, namely to establish a quality management system, in a simplified manner which would reduce the administrative burden and the costs for those enterprises without affecting the level of protection and the need for compliance with the requirements for high-risk AI systems. The Commission should develop guidelines to specify the elements of the quality management system to be fulfilled in this simplified manner by microenterprises. (75) It is appropriate that the Commission facilitates, to the extent possible, access to Testing and Experimentation Facilities to bodies, groups or laboratories established or accredited pursuant to any relevant Union harmonisation legislation and which fulfil tasks in the context of conformity assessment of products or devices covered by that Union harmonisation legislation.',\n",
       " \"This is notably the case for expert panels, expert laboratories and reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746. (75a) This Regulation should establish a governance framework that both allows to coordinate and support the application of this Regulation at national level, as well as build capabilities at Union level and integrate stakeholders in the field of artificial intelligence. The effective implementation and enforcement of this Regulation require a governance framework that allows to coordinate and build up central expertise at Union level. The Commission has established the AI Office by Commission decision of […], which has as its mission to develop Union expertise and capabilities in the field of artificial intelligence and to contribute to the implementation of Union legislation on artificial intelligence. Member States should facilitate the tasks of the AI Office with a view to support the development of Union expertise and capabilities at Union level and to strengthen the functioning of the digital single market. Furthermore, a European Artificial Intelligence Board composed of representatives of the Member States, a scientific panel to integrate the scientific community and an advisory forum to contribute stakeholder input to the implementation of this Regulation, both at national and Union level, should be established. The development of Union expertise and capabilities should also include making use of existing resources and expertise, notably through synergies with structures built up in the context of the Union level enforcement of other legislation and synergies with related initiatives at Union level, such as the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and the AI Testing and Experimentation Facilities under the Digital Europe Programme. (76) In order to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this Regulation a European Artificial Intelligence Board should be established. The Board should reflect the various interests of the AI eco-system and be composed of representatives of the Member States. The Board should be responsible for a number of advisory tasks, including issuing opinions, recommendations, advice or contributing to guidance on matters related to the implementation of this Regulation, including on enforcement matters, technical specifications or existing standards regarding the requirements established in this Regulation and providing advice to the Commission and the Member States and their national competent authorities on specific questions related to artificial intelligence. In order to give some flexibility to Member States in the designation of their representatives in the AI Board, such representatives may be any persons belonging to public entities who should have the relevant competences and powers to facilitate coordination at national level and contribute to the achievement of the Board's tasks.\",\n",
       " 'The Board should establish two standing sub-groups to provide a platform for cooperation and exchange among market surveillance authorities and notifying authorities on issues related respectively to market surveillance and notified bodies. The standing subgroup for market surveillance should act as the Administrative Cooperation Group (ADCO) for this Regulation in the meaning of Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. In line with the role and tasks of the Commission pursuant to Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, the Commission should support the activities of the standing subgroup for market surveillance by undertaking market evaluations or studies, notably with a view to identifying aspects of this Regulation requiring specific and urgent coordination among market surveillance authorities. The Board may establish other standing or temporary sub-groups as appropriate for the purpose of examining specific issues. The Board should also cooperate, as appropriate, with relevant EU bodies, expert groups and networks active in the context of relevant EU legislation, including in particular those active under relevant EU regulation on data, digital products and services. (76x) With a view to ensure the involvement of stakeholders in the implementation and application of this Regulation, an advisory forum should be established to advise and provide technical expertise to the Board and the Commission. To ensure a varied and balanced stakeholder representation between commercial and non-commercial interest and, within the category of commercial interests, with regards to SMEs and other undertakings, the advisory forum should comprise inter alia industry, start-ups, SMEs, academia, civil society, including social partners, as well as the Fundamental Rights Agency, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). (76y) To support the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, in particular the monitoring activities of the AI Office as regards general-purpose AI models, a scientific panel of independent experts should be established. The independent experts constituting the scientific panel should be selected on the basis of up-to-date scientific or technical expertise in the field of artificial intelligence and should perform their tasks with impartiality, objectivity and ensure the confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks and activities. To allow reinforcing national capacities necessary for the effective enforcement of this Regulation, Member States should be able to request support from the pool of experts constituting the scientific panel for their enforcement activities.',\n",
       " '(76a) In order to support adequate enforcement as regards AI systems and reinforce the capacities of the Member States, EU AI testing support structures should be established and made available to the Member States. (77) Member States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this Regulation. In this respect, each Member State should designate at least one notifying authority and at least one market surveillance authority as national competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the application and implementation of this Regulation. Member States may decide to appoint any kind of public entity to perform the tasks of the national competent authorities within the meaning of this Regulation, in accordance with their specific national organisational characteristics and needs. In order to increase organisation efficiency on the side of Member States and to set a single point of contact vis-à-vis the public and other counterparts at Member State and Union levels, each Member State should designate a market surveillance authority to act as single point of contact. (77a) The national competent authorities should exercise their powers independently, impartially and without bias, so as to safeguard the principles of objectivity of their activities and tasks and to ensure the application and implementation of this Regulation. The members of these authorities should refrain from any action incompatible with their duties and should be subject to confidentiality rules under this Regulation. (78) In order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into account the experience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their systems and the design and development process or can take any possible corrective action in a timely manner, all providers should have a post-market monitoring system in place. Where relevant, post- market monitoring should include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems including other devices and software. Post-market monitoring should not cover sensitive operational data of deployers which are law enforcement authorities. This system is also key to ensure that the possible risks emerging from AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ after being placed on the market or put into service can be more efficiently and timely addressed. In this context, providers should also be required to have a system in place to report to the relevant authorities any serious incidents resulting from the use of their AI systems, meaning incident or malfunctioning leading to death or serious damage to health, serious and irreversible disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure, breaches of obligations under Union law intended to protect fundamental rights or serious damage to property or the environment.',\n",
       " '(79) In order to ensure an appropriate and effective enforcement of the requirements and obligations set out by this Regulation, which is Union harmonisation legislation, the system of market surveillance and compliance of products established by Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should apply in its entirety. Market surveillance authorities designated pursuant to this Regulation should have all enforcement powers under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and should exercise their powers and carry out their duties independently, impartially and without bias. Although the majority of AI systems are not subject to specific requirements and obligations under this Regulation, market surveillance authorities may take measures in relation to all AI systems when they present a risk in accordance with this Regulation. Due to the specific nature of Union institutions, agencies and bodies falling within the scope of this Regulation, it is appropriate to designate the European Data Protection Supervisor as a competent market surveillance authority for them. This should be without prejudice to the designation of national competent authorities by the Member States. Market surveillance activities should not affect the ability of the supervised entities to carry out their tasks independently, when such independence is required by Union law. (79a) This Regulation is without prejudice to the competences, tasks, powers and independence of relevant national public authorities or bodies which supervise the application of Union law protecting fundamental rights, including equality bodies and data protection authorities. Where necessary for their mandate, those national public authorities or bodies should also have access to any documentation created under this Regulation. A specific safeguard procedure should be set for ensuring adequate and timely enforcement against AI systems presenting a risk to health, safety and fundamental rights. The procedure for such AI systems presenting a risk should be applied to high-risk AI systems presenting a risk, prohibited systems which have been placed on the market, put into service or used in violation of the prohibited practices laid down in this Regulation and AI systems which have been made available in violation of the transparency requirements laid down in this Regulation and present a risk. (80) Union legislation on financial services includes internal governance and risk management rules and requirements which are applicable to regulated financial institutions in the course of provision of those services, including when they make use of AI systems.',\n",
       " 'In order to ensure coherent application and enforcement of the obligations under this Regulation and relevant rules and requirements of the Union financial services legislation, the competent authorities for the supervision and enforcement of the financial services legislation, notably competent authorities as defined in Directive 2009/138/EC, Directive (EU) 2016/97, Directive 2013/36/EU Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, Directive 2008/48/EC and Directive 2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, should be designated, within their respective competences, as competent authorities for the purpose of supervising the implementation of this Regulation, including for market surveillance activities, as regards AI systems provided or used by regulated and supervised financial institutions unless Member States decide to designate another authority to fulfil these market surveillance tasks. Those competent authorities should have all powers under this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 on market surveillance to enforce the requirements and obligations of this Regulation, including powers to carry our ex post market surveillance activities that can be integrated, as appropriate, into their existing supervisory mechanisms and procedures under the relevant Union financial services legislation. It is appropriate to envisage that, when acting as market surveillance authorities under this Regulation, the national authorities responsible for the supervision of credit institutions regulated under Directive 2013/36/EU, which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) established by Council Regulation No 1024/2013, should report, without delay, to the European Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the European Central Bank’s prudential supervisory tasks as specified in that Regulation. To further enhance the consistency between this Regulation and the rules applicable to credit institutions regulated under Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council27, it is also appropriate to integrate some of the providers’ procedural obligations in relation to risk management, post marketing monitoring and documentation into the existing obligations and procedures under Directive 2013/36/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited derogations should also be envisaged in relation to the quality management system of providers and the monitoring obligation placed on deployers of high-risk AI systems to the extent that these apply to credit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU.',\n",
       " 'The same regime should apply to insurance and re-insurance undertakings and insurance holding companies under Directive 2009/138/EU (Solvency II) and the insurance intermediaries under Directive 2016/97/EU and other types of financial institutions subject to requirements regarding internal governance, arrangements or processes established pursuant to the relevant Union financial services legislation to ensure consistency and equal treatment in the financial sector. (80-x) Each market surveillance authority for high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III insofar as these systems are used for law enforcement purposes and for purposes listed in points 6, 7 and 8 of Annex III should have effective investigative and corrective powers, including at least the power to obtain access to all personal data that are being processed and to all information necessary for the performance of its tasks. The market surveillance authorities should be able to exercise their powers by acting with complete independence. Any limitations of their access to sensitive operational data under this Regulation should be without prejudice to the powers conferred to them by Directive 2016/680. No exclusion on disclosing data to national data protection authorities under this Regulation should affect the current or future powers of those authorities beyond the scope of this Regulation. (80x) The market surveillance authorities of the Member States and the Commission should be able to propose joint activities, including joint investigations, to be conducted by market surveillance authorities or market surveillance authorities jointly with the Commission, that have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising awareness and providing guidance in relation to this Regulation with respect to specific categories of high-risk AI systems that are found to present a serious risk across several Member States. Joint activities to promote compliance should be carried out in accordance with Article 9 of the 2019/1020. The AI Office should provide coordination support for joint investigations. (80y) It is necessary to clarify the responsibilities and competences on national and Union level as regards AI systems that are built on general-purpose AI models. To avoid overlapping competences, where an AI system is based on a general-purpose AI model and the model and system are provided by the same provider, the supervision should take place at Union level through the AI Office, which should have the powers of a market surveillance authority within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 for this purpose. In all other cases, national market surveillance authorities remain responsible for the supervision of AI systems.',\n",
       " 'However, for general-purpose AI systems that can be used directly by deployers for at least one purpose that is classified as high-risk, market surveillance authorities should cooperate with the AI Office to carry out evaluations of compliance and inform the Board and other market surveillance authorities accordingly. Furthermore, market surveillance authorities should be able to request assistance from the AI Office where the market surveillance authority is unable to conclude an investigation on a high-risk AI system because of its inability to access certain information related to the general-purpose AI model on which the high-risk AI system is built. In such cases, the procedure regarding mutual assistance in cross-border cases in Chapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should apply by analogy. (80z) To make best use of the centralised Union expertise and synergies at Union level, the powers of supervision and enforcement of the obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models should be a competence of the Commission. The Commission should entrust the implementation of these tasks to the AI Office, without prejudice to the powers of organisation of the Commission and the division of competences between member States and the Union based on the Treaties. The AI Office should be able to carry out all necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of this Regulation as regards general-purpose AI models. It should be able to investigate possible infringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI models both on its own initiative, following the results of its monitoring activities, or upon request from market surveillance authorities in line with the conditions set out in this Regulation. To support effective monitoring of the AI Office, it should provide for the possibility that downstream providers lodge complaints about possible infringements of the rules on providers of general purpose AI models. (80z+1) With a view to complement the governance systems for general-purpose AI models, the scientific panel should support the monitoring activities of the AI Office and may, in certain cases, provide qualified alerts to the AI Office which trigger follow-ups such as investigations. This should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model poses a concrete and identifiable risk at Union level. Furthermore, this should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect that a general-purpose AI model meets the criteria that would lead to a classification as general- purpose AI model with systemic risk.',\n",
       " 'To equip the scientific panel with the information necessary for the performance of these tasks, there should be a mechanism whereby the scientific panel can request the Commission to require documentation or information from a provider. (80z+2) The AI Office should be able to take the necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with the obligations for providers of general purpose AI models laid down in this Regulation. The AI Office should be able to investigate possible infringements in accordance with the powers provided for in this Regulation, including by requesting documentation and information, by conducting evaluations, as well as by requesting measures from providers of general purpose AI models. In the conduct of evaluations, in order to make use of independent expertise, the AI Office should be able to involve independent experts to carry out the evaluations on its behalf. Compliance with the obligations should be enforceable, inter alia, through requests to take appropriate measures, including risk mitigation measures in case of identified systemic risks as well as restricting the making available on the market, withdrawing or recalling the model. As a safeguard in case needed beyond the procedural rights provided for in this Regulation, providers of general-purpose AI models should have the procedural rights provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, which should apply by analogy, without prejudice to more specific procedural rights provided for by this Regulation. (81) The development of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation may lead to a larger uptake of ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence in the Union. Providers of non-high-risk AI systems should be encouraged to create codes of conduct, including related governance mechanisms, intended to foster the voluntary application of some or all of the mandatory requirements applicable to high-risk AI systems, adapted in light of the intended purpose of the systems and the lower risk involved and taking into account the available technical solutions and industry best practices such as model and data cards.',\n",
       " 'Providers and, as appropriate, deployers of all AI systems, high-risk or not, and models should also be encouraged to apply on a voluntary basis additional requirements related, for example, to the elements of the European ethic guidelines for trustworthy AI, environmental sustainability, AI literacy measures, inclusive and diverse design and development of AI systems, including attention to vulnerable persons and accessibility to persons with disability, stakeholders’ participation with the involvement as appropriate, of relevant stakeholders such as business and civil society organisations, academia and research organisations, trade unions and consumer protection organisation in the design and development of AI systems, and diversity of the development teams, including gender balance. To ensure that the voluntary codes of conduct are effective, they should be based on clear objectives and key performance indicators to measure the achievement of those objectives. They should be also developed in an inclusive way, as appropriate, with the involvement of relevant stakeholders such as business and civil society organisations, academia and research organisations, trade unions and consumer protection organisation. The Commission may develop initiatives, including of a sectorial nature, to facilitate the lowering of technical barriers hindering cross-border exchange of data for AI development, including on data access infrastructure, semantic and technical interoperability of different types of data. (82) It is important that AI systems related to products that are not high-risk in accordance with this Regulation and thus are not required to comply with the requirements set out for high- risk AI systems are nevertheless safe when placed on the market or put into service. To contribute to this objective, Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of the Council28 would apply as a safety net. (83) In order to ensure trustful and constructive cooperation of competent authorities on Union and national level, all parties involved in the application of this Regulation should respect the confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks, in accordance with Union or national law. They should carry out their tasks and activities in such a manner as to protect, in particular, intellectual property rights, confidential business information and trade secrets, the effective implementation of this Regulation, public and national security interests, the integrity of criminal or administrative proceedings, and the integrity of classified information. (84) Compliance with this Regulation should be enforceable by means of the imposition of penalties and other enforcement measures.',\n",
       " 'Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by laying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement, and in respect of the ne bis in idem principle. In order to strengthen and harmonise administrative penalties for infringement of this Regulation, the upper limits for setting the administrative fines for certain specific infringements should be laid down. When assessing the amount of the fines, Member States should, in each individual case, take into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in particular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and of its consequences and to the provider’s size, in particular if the provider is an SME including a start-up. The European Data Protection Supervisor should have the power to impose fines on Union institutions, agencies and bodies falling within the scope of this Regulation. (84a) Compliance with the obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models imposed under this Regulation should be enforceable among others by means of fines. To that end, appropriate levels of fines should also be laid down for infringement of those obligations,  including the failure to comply with measures requested by the Commission in accordance with this Regulation, subject to appropriate limitation periods in accordance with the principle of proportionality. All decisions taken by the Commission under this Regulation are subject to review by the Court of Justice of the European Union in accordance with the TFEU. (84aa) Union and national law already provides effective remedies to natural and legal persons whose rights and freedoms are adversely affected by the use of AI systems. Without prejudice to those remedies, any natural or legal person having grounds to consider that there has been an infringement of the provisions of this Regulation should be entitled to lodge a complaint to the relevant market surveillance authority or the AI Office where applicable. (84b) Affected persons should have the right to request an explanation when a decision is taken by the deployer with the output from certain high-risk systems as provided for in this Regulation as the main basis and which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects him or her in a way that they consider to adversely impact their health, safety or fundamental rights. This explanation should be a clear and meaningful and should provide a basis for affected persons to exercise their rights. This should not apply to the use of AI systems for which exceptions or restrictions follow from Union or national law and should apply only to the extent this right is not already provided for under Union legislation.',\n",
       " '(84c) Persons acting as ‘whistle-blowers’ on the breaches of this Regulation should be afforded the protection guaranteed by Union legislation on the protection of persons who report breaches of law. Therefore, Directive (EU) 2019/1937 should apply to the reporting of breaches of this Regulation and the protection of persons reporting such breaches. (85) In order to ensure that the regulatory framework can be adapted where necessary, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to amend the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, the high-risk AI systems listed in Annex III, the provisions regarding technical documentation listed in Annex IV, the content of the EU declaration of conformity in Annex V, the provisions regarding the conformity assessment procedures in Annex VI and VII, the provisions establishing the high-risk AI systems to which the conformity assessment procedure based on assessment of the quality management system and assessment of the technical documentation should apply, the threshold as well as to supplement benchmarks and indicators in the rules for classification of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, the criteria for the designation of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk in Annex IXc, the technical documentation for providers of general-purpose AI models in Annex VIIIb and the transparency information for providers of general-purpose AI models in Annex VIIIc. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making1. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. (85a) Given the rapid technological developments and the required technical expertise in the effective application of this Regulation, the Commission should evaluate and review this Regulation by three years after the date of entry into application and every four years thereafter and report to the European Parliament and the Council. In addition, taking into account the implications for the scope of this Regulation, the Commission should carry out an assessment of the need to amend the list in Annex III and the list of prohibited practices once a year.',\n",
       " 'Moreover, by two years after entry into application and every four years thereafter, the Commission should evaluate and report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the need to amend the high-risk areas in Annex III, the AI systems within the scope of the transparency obligations in Title IV, the effectiveness of the supervision and governance system and the progress on the development of standardisation deliverables on energy efficient development of general-purpose AI models, including the need for further measures or actions. Finally, within two years after the entry into application and every three years thereafter, the Commission should evaluate the impact and effectiveness of voluntary codes of conducts to foster the application of the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2, for systems other than high-risk AI systems and possibly other additional requirements for such AI systems. (86) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council1. (87) Since the objective of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. (87a) In order to ensure legal certainty, ensure an appropriate adaptation period for operators and avoid disruption to the market, including by ensuring continuity of the use of AI systems, it is appropriate that this Regulation applies to the high-risk AI systems that have been placed on the market or put into service before the general date of application thereof, only if, from that date, those systems are subject to significant changes in their design or intended purpose. It is appropriate to clarify that, in this respect, the concept of significant change should be understood as equivalent in substance to the notion of substantial modification, which is used with regard only to high-risk AI systems as defined in this Regulation.',\n",
       " 'By way of exception and in light of public accountability, operators of AI systems which are components of the large-scale IT systems established by the legal acts listed in Annex IX and operators of high-risk AI systems that are intended to be used by public authorities should take the necessary steps to comply with the requirements of this Regulation by end of 2030 and by four years after the entry into application respectively. (87b) Providers of high-risk AI systems are encouraged to start to comply, on voluntary basis, with the relevant obligations foreseen under this Regulation already during the transitional period. (88) This Regulation should apply from … [OP – please insert the date established in Art. However, taking into account the unacceptable risk associated with the use of AI in certain ways, the prohibitions should apply already from … [OP – please insert the date – 6 months after entry into force of this Regulation]. While the full effect of these prohibitions follows with the establishment of the governance and enforcement of this Regulation, anticipating the application of the prohibitions is important to take account of unacceptable risk and has effect on other procedures, such as in civil law. Moreover, the infrastructure related to the governance and the conformity assessment system should be operational before [OP – please insert the date established in Art. 85], therefore the provisions on notified bodies and governance structure should apply from … [OP – please insert the date – twelve months following the entry into force of this Regulation]. Given the rapid pace of technological advancements and adoption of general-purpose AI models, obligations for providers of general purpose AI models should apply within 12 months from the date of entry into force. Codes of Practice should be ready at the latest 3 months before the entry into application of the relevant provisions, to enable providers to demonstrate compliance in time. The AI Office should ensure that classification rules and procedures are up to date in light of technological developments. In addition, Member States should lay down and notify to the Commission the rules on penalties, including administrative fines, and ensure that they are properly and effectively implemented by the date of application of this Regulation. Therefore, the provisions on penalties should apply from [OP – please insert the date – twelve months following the entry into force of this Regulation].

TITLE III HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS Chapter 1 CLASSIFICATION OF AI SYSTEMS AS HIGH-RISK Article 6 Classification rules for high-risk AI systems 1. Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service independently from the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be considered high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II. (b) the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or putting into service of that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in Annex III shall also be considered high-risk. By derogation from paragraph 2 AI systems shall not be considered as high risk if they do not pose a significant risk of harm, to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision making. This shall be the case if one or more of the following criteria are fulfilled: (a) the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task. (b) the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity.',\n",
       " '(c) the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the previously completed human assessment, without proper human review. or (d) the AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant for the purpose of the use cases listed in Annex III. Notwithstanding first subparagraph of this paragraph, an AI system shall always be considered high-risk if the AI system performs profiling of natural persons. A provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk shall document its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service. Such provider shall be subject to the registration obligation set out in Article 51(1a). Upon request of national competent authorities, the provider shall provide the documentation of the assessment. The Commission shall, after consulting the AI Board, and no later than 18 months after the entry into force of this Regulation, provide guidelines specifying the practical implementation of this article completed by a comprehensive list of practical examples of high risk and non-high risk use cases on AI systems in accordance with the conditions set out in Article 82a. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to amend the criteria laid down in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a. The Commission may adopt delegated acts adding new criteria to those laid down in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a, or modifying them, only where there is concrete and reliable evidence of the existence of AI systems that fall under the scope of Annex III but that do not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety and fundamental rights. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts deleting any of the criteria laid down in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a where there is concrete and reliable evidence that this is necessary for the purpose of maintaining the level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights in the Union. Any amendment to the criteria laid down in points (a) to (d) set out in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2a shall not decrease the overall level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights in the Union. When adopting the delegated acts, the Commission shall ensure consistency with the delegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(1) and shall take account of market and technological developments. Article 7 Amendments to Annex III 1.',\n",
       " 'The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to amend Annex III by adding or modifying use cases of high-risk AI systems where both of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the AI systems are intended to be used in any of the areas listed in points 1 to 8 of Annex III. (b) the AI systems pose a risk of harm to health and safety, or an adverse impact on fundamental rights, and that risk is equivalent to or greater than the risk of harm or of adverse impact posed by the high-risk AI systems already referred to in Annex III. When assessing for the purposes of paragraph 1 whether an AI system poses a risk of harm to the health and safety or a risk of adverse impact on fundamental rights that is equivalent to or greater than the risk of harm posed by the high-risk AI systems already referred to in Annex III, the Commission shall take into account the following criteria: (a) the intended purpose of the AI system. (b) the extent to which an AI system has been used or is likely to be used. (ba) the nature and amount of the data processed and used by the AI system, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed. (bb) the extent to which the AI system acts autonomously and the possibility for a human to override a decision or recommendations that may lead to potential harm. (c) the extent to which the use of an AI system has already caused harm to health and safety, has had an adverse impact on fundamental rights or has given rise to significant concerns in relation to the likelihood of such harm or adverse impact, as demonstrated for example by reports or documented allegations submitted to national competent authorities or by other reports, as appropriate. (d) the potential extent of such harm or such adverse impact, in particular in terms of its intensity and its ability to affect a plurality of persons or to disproportionately affect a particular group of persons. (e) the extent to which potentially harmed or adversely impacted persons are dependent on the outcome produced with an AI system, in particular because for practical or legal reasons it is not reasonably possible to opt-out from that outcome. (f) the extent to which there is an imbalance of power, or the potentially harmed or adversely impacted persons are in a vulnerable position in relation to the user of an AI system, in particular due to status, authority, knowledge, economic or social circumstances, or age.',\n",
       " '(g) the extent to which the outcome produced involving an AI system is easily corrigible or reversible, taking into account the technical solutions available to correct or reverse, whereby outcomes having and adverse impact on health, safety, fundamental rights, shall not be considered as easily corrigible or reversible. (gb) the magnitude and likelihood of benefit of the deployment of the AI system for individuals, groups, or society at large, including possible improvements in product safety. (h) the extent to which existing Union legislation provides for: (i) effective measures of redress in relation to the risks posed by an AI system, with the exclusion of claims for damages. (ii) effective measures to prevent or substantially minimise those risks. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to amend the list in Annex III by removing high-risk AI systems where both of the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the high-risk AI system(s) concerned no longer pose any significant risks to fundamental rights, health or safety, taking into account the criteria listed in paragraph 2. (b) the deletion does not decrease the overall level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights under Union law. Chapter 2 REQUIREMENTS FOR HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS Article 8 Compliance with the requirements 1. High-risk AI systems shall comply with the requirements established in this Chapter, taking into account its intended purpose as well as the generally acknowledged state of the art on AI and AI related technologies. The risk management system referred to in Article 9 shall be taken into account when ensuring compliance with those requirements. Where a product contains an artificial intelligence system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as well as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A apply, providers shall be responsible for ensuring that their product is fully compliant with all applicable requirements required under the Union harmonisation legislation. In ensuring the compliance of high-risk AI systems referred in paragraph 1 with the requirements set out in Chapter 2 of this Title, and in order to ensure consistency, avoid duplications and minimise additional burdens, providers shall have a choice to integrate, as appropriate, the necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation they provide with regard to their product into already existing documentation and procedures required under the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II, Section A. Article 9 Risk management system 1. A risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to high-risk AI systems.',\n",
       " 'The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process planned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps: (a) identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk AI system can pose to the health, safety or fundamental rights when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose. (b) estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose and under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse. (c) evaluation of other possibly arising risks based on the analysis of data gathered from the post-market monitoring system referred to in Article 61. (d) adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to address the risks identified pursuant to point a of this paragraph in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs. The risks referred to in this paragraph shall concern only those which may be reasonably mitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or the provision of adequate technical information. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall give due consideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined application of the requirements set out in this Chapter 2, with a view to minimising risks more effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures to fulfil those requirements. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d) shall be such that relevant residual risk associated with each hazard as well as the overall residual risk of the high-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable. In identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be ensured: (a) elimination or reduction of identified risks and evaluated pursuant to paragraph 2 as far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-risk AI system. (b) where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures addressing risks that cannot be eliminated. (c) provision of the required information pursuant to Article 13, referred to in paragraph 2, point (b) of this Article, and, where appropriate, training to deployers. With a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, due consideration shall be given to the technical knowledge, experience, education, training to be expected by the deployer and the presumable context in which the system is intended to be used.',\n",
       " 'High-risk AI systems shall be tested for the purposes of identifying the most appropriate and targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems perform consistently for their intended purpose and they are in compliance with the requirements set out in this Chapter. Testing procedures may include testing in real world conditions in accordance with Article 54a. The testing of the high-risk AI systems shall be performed, as appropriate, at any point in time throughout the development process, and, in any event, prior to the placing on the market or the putting into service. Testing shall be made against prior defined metrics and probabilistic thresholds that are appropriate to the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system. When implementing the risk management system described in paragraphs 1 to 6, providers shall give consideration to whether in view of its intended purpose the high-risk AI system is likely to adversely impact persons under the age of 18 and, as appropriate, other vulnerable groups of people. For providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements regarding internal risk management processes under relevant sectorial Union law, the aspects described in paragraphs 1 to 8 may be part of or combined with the risk management procedures established pursuant to that law. Article 10 Data and data governance 1. High-risk AI systems which make use of techniques involving the training of models with data shall be developed on the basis of training, validation and testing data sets that meet the quality criteria referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5 whenever such datasets are used. Training, validation and testing data sets shall be subject to appropriate data governance and management practices appropriate for the intended purpose of the AI system. Those practices shall concern in particular: (a) the relevant design choices. (aa) data collection processes and origin of data, and in the case of personal data, the original purpose of data collection. (c) relevant data preparation processing operations, such as annotation, labelling, cleaning, updating, enrichment and aggregation. (d) the formulation of assumptions, notably with respect to the information that the data are supposed to measure and represent. (e) an assessment of the availability, quantity and suitability of the data sets that are needed. (f) examination in view of possible biases that are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, negatively impact fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future operations. (fa) appropriate measures to detect, prevent and mitigate possible biases identified according to point (f).',\n",
       " '(g) the identification of relevant data gaps or shortcomings that prevent compliance with this Regulation, and how those gaps and shortcomings can be addressed. Training, validation and testing datasets shall be relevant, sufficiently representative, and to the best extent possible, free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose. They shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as regards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI system is intended to be used. These characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of individual data sets or a combination thereof. Datasets shall take into account, to the extent required by the intended purpose, the characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual, behavioural or functional setting within which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used. To the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purposes of ensuring bias detection and correction in relation to the high-risk AI systems in accordance with the second paragraph, point f and fa, the providers of such systems may exceptionally process special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. In addition to provisions set out in the Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, all the following conditions shall apply in order for such processing to occur: (a) the bias detection and correction cannot be effectively fulfilled by processing other data, including synthetic or anonymised data. (b) the special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are subject to technical limitations on the re-use of the personal data and state of the art security and privacy-preserving measures, including pseudonymisation. (c) the special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are subject to measures to ensure that the personal data processed are secured, protected, subject to suitable safeguards, including strict controls and documentation of the access, to avoid misuse and ensure only authorised persons have access to those personal data with appropriate confidentiality obligations. (d) the special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are not to be transmitted, transferred or otherwise accessed by other parties.',\n",
       " '(e) the special categories of personal data processed for the purpose of this paragraph are deleted once the bias has been corrected or the personal data has reached the end of its retention period, whatever comes first. (f) the records of processing activities pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 includes justification why the processing of special categories of personal data was strictly necessary to detect and correct biases and this objective could not be achieved by processing other data. For the development of high-risk AI systems not using techniques involving the training of models, paragraphs 2 to 5 shall apply only to the testing data sets. Article 11 Technical documentation 1. The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system is placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to date. The technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way to demonstrate that the high- risk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Chapter and provide national competent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a clear and comprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those requirements. It shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex IV. SMEs, including start-ups, may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified in Annex IV in a simplified manner. For this purpose, the Commission shall establish a simplified technical documentation form targeted at the needs of small and micro enterprises. Where an SME, including start-ups, opts to provide the information required in Annex IV in a simplified manner, it shall use the form referred to in this paragraph. Notified bodies shall accept the form for the purpose of conformity assessment. Where a high-risk AI system related to a product, to which the legal acts listed in Annex II, section A apply, is placed on the market or put into service one single technical documentation shall be drawn up containing all the information set out in paragraph 1 as well as the information required under those legal acts. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73 to amend Annex IV where necessary to ensure that, in the light of technical progress, the technical documentation provides all the necessary information to assess the compliance of the system with the requirements set out in this Chapter. Article 12 Record-keeping 1. High-risk AI systems shall technically allow for the automatic recording of events (‘logs’) over the duration of the lifetime of the system.',\n",
       " 'In order to ensure a level of traceability of the AI system’s functioning that is appropriate to the intended purpose of the system, logging capabilities shall enable the recording of events relevant for: (i) identification of situations that may result in the AI system presenting a risk within the meaning of Article 65(1) or in a substantial modification. (ii) facilitation of the post-market monitoring referred to in Article 61. and (iii) monitoring of the operation of high-risk AI systems referred to in Article 29(4). For high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, point (a) of Annex III, the logging capabilities shall provide, at a minimum: (a) recording of the period of each use of the system (start date and time and end date and time of each use). (b) the reference database against which input data has been checked by the system. (c) the input data for which the search has led to a match. (d) the identification of the natural persons involved in the verification of the results, as referred to in Article 14 (5). Article 13 Transparency and provision of information to deployers 1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way to ensure that their operation is sufficiently transparent to enable deployers to interpret the system’s output and use it appropriately. An appropriate type and degree of transparency shall be ensured with a view to achieving compliance with the relevant obligations of the provider and deployer set out in Chapter 3 of this Title. High-risk AI systems shall be accompanied by instructions for use in an appropriate digital format or otherwise that include concise, complete, correct and clear information that is relevant, accessible and comprehensible to users. The instructions for use shall contain at least the following information: (a) the identity and the contact details of the provider and, where applicable, of its authorised representative. (b) the characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance of the high-risk AI system, including: (i) its intended purpose. (ii) the level of accuracy, including its metrics, robustness and cybersecurity referred to in Article 15 against which the high-risk AI system has been tested and validated and which can be expected, and any known and foreseeable circumstances that may have an impact on that expected level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity.',\n",
       " '(iii) any known or foreseeable circumstance, related to the use of the high-risk AI system in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights referred to in Article 9(2). (iiia) where applicable, the technical capabilities and characteristics of the AI system to provide information that is relevant to explain its output. (iv) when appropriate, its performance regarding specific persons or groups of persons on which the system is intended to be used. (v) when appropriate, specifications for the input data, or any other relevant information in terms of the training, validation and testing data sets used, taking into account the intended purpose of the AI system. (va) where applicable, information to enable deployers to interpret the system’s output and use it appropriately. (c) the changes to the high-risk AI system and its performance which have been pre- determined by the provider at the moment of the initial conformity assessment, if any. (d) the human oversight measures referred to in Article 14, including the technical measures put in place to facilitate the interpretation of the outputs of AI systems by the deployers. (e) the computational and hardware resources needed, the expected lifetime of the high- risk AI system and any necessary maintenance and care measures, including their frequency, to ensure the proper functioning of that AI system, including as regards software updates. (ea) where relevant, a description of the mechanisms included within the AI system that allows users to properly collect, store and interpret the logs in accordance with Article 12. Article 14 Human oversight 1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with appropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which the AI system is in use. Human oversight shall aim at preventing or minimising the risks to health, safety or fundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, in particular when such risks persist notwithstanding the application of other requirements set out in this Chapter. The oversight measures shall be commensurate to the risks, level of autonomy and context of use of the AI system and shall be ensured through either one or all of the following types of measures: (a) measures identified and built, when technically feasible, into the high-risk AI system by the provider before it is placed on the market or put into service.',\n",
       " '(b) measures identified by the provider before placing the high-risk AI system on the market or putting it into service and that are appropriate to be implemented by the user. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1 to 3, the high-risk AI system shall be provided to the user in such a way that natural persons to whom human oversight is assigned are enabled, as appropriate and proportionate to the circumstances: (a) to properly understand the relevant capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI system and be able to duly monitor its operation, also in view of detecting and addressing anomalies, dysfunctions and unexpected performance. (b) to remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on the output produced by a high-risk AI system (‘automation bias’), in particular for high-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for decisions to be taken by natural persons. (c) to correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output, taking into account for example the interpretation tools and methods available. (d) to decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or otherwise disregard, override or reverse the output of the high-risk AI system. (e) to intervene on the operation of the high-risk AI system or interrupt, the system through a \"stop\" button or a similar procedure that allows the system to come to a halt in a safe state. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a) of Annex III, the measures referred to in paragraph 3 shall be such as to ensure that, in addition, no action or decision is taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons with the necessary competence, training and authority. The requirement for a separate verification by at least two natural persons shall not apply to high risk AI systems used for the purpose of law enforcement, migration, border control or asylum, in cases where Union or national law considers the application of this requirement to be disproportionate. Article 15 Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity 1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way that they achieve an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity, and perform consistently in those respects throughout their lifecycle.',\n",

TITLE VIIIA GENERAL PURPOSE AI MODELS Chapter 1 CLASSIFICATION RULES Article 52a Classification of general purpose AI models as general purpose AI models with systemic risk 1. A general purpose AI model shall be classified as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it meets any of the following criteria: (a) it has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, including indicators and benchmarks. (b) based on a decision of the Commission, ex officio or following a qualified alert by the scientific panel that a general purpose AI model has capabilities or impact equivalent to those of point (a). A general purpose AI model shall be presumed to have high impact capabilities pursuant to point a) of paragraph 1 when the cumulative amount of compute used for its training measured in floating point operations (FLOPs) is greater than 10^25. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 73(2) to amend the thresholds listed in the paragraphs above, as well as to supplement benchmarks and indicators in light of evolving technological developments, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, when necessary, for these thresholds to reflect the state of the art. Article 52b Procedure 1. Where a general purpose AI model meets the requirements referred to in points (a) of Article 52a(1), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any event within 2 weeks after those requirements are met or it becomes known that these requirements will be met.',\n",
       " 'That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the relevant requirements have been met. If the Commission becomes aware of a general purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk. The provider of a general purpose AI model that meets the requirements referred to in points (a) of Article 52a(1) may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets the said requirements, the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks and therefore should not be classified as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk. Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 are not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate that the general purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic risks, it shall reject those arguments and the general purpose AI model shall be considered as general purpose AI model with systemic risk. The Commission may designate a general purpose AI model as presenting systemic risks, ex officio or following a qualified alert of the scientific panel pursuant to point (a) of Article 68h [Alerts of systemic risks by the scientific panel] (1) on the basis of criteria set out in Annex IXc. The Commission shall be empowered to specify and update the criteria in Annex IXc by means of delegated acts in accordance with Article 74(2). Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general purpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general purpose AI model can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex IXc. Such request shall contain objective, concrete and new reasons that have arisen since the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its reassessment, decides to maintain the designation as general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after this decision. The Commission shall ensure that a list of general purpose AI models with systemic risk is published and shall keep that list up to date, without prejudice to the need to respect and protect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in accordance with Union and national law.',\n",

Where relevant and limited to what is necessary to fulfil their tasks, the notified body shall be granted full access to the training, validation, and testing datasets used, including, where appropriate and subject to security safeguards, through application programming interfaces (API) or other relevant technical means and tools enabling remote access. In examining the technical documentation, the notified body may require that the provider supplies further evidence or carries out further tests so as to enable a proper assessment of conformity of the AI system with the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2. Whenever the notified body is not satisfied with the tests carried out by the provider, the notified body shall directly carry out adequate tests, as appropriate. Where necessary to assess the conformity of the high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2, after all other reasonable ways to verify conformity have been exhausted and have proven to be insufficient, and upon a reasoned request, the notified body shall also be granted access to the training and trained models of the AI system, including its relevant parameters. Such access shall be subject to existing Union law on the protection of intellectual property and trade secrets. The decision shall be notified to the provider or its authorised representative. The notification shall contain the conclusions of the assessment of the technical documentation and the reasoned assessment decision. Where the AI system is in conformity with the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2, an EU technical documentation assessment certificate shall be issued by the notified body. The certificate shall indicate the name and address of the provider, the conclusions of the examination, the conditions (if any) for its validity and the data necessary for the identification of the AI system. The certificate and its annexes shall contain all relevant information to allow the conformity of the AI system to be evaluated, and to allow for control of the AI system while in use, where applicable. Where the AI system is not in conformity with the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2, the notified body shall refuse to issue an EU technical documentation assessment certificate and shall inform the applicant accordingly, giving detailed reasons for its refusal. Where the AI system does not meet the requirement relating to the data used to train it, re- training of the AI system will be needed prior to the application for a new conformity assessment.',\n",

Any change to the AI system that could affect the compliance of the AI system with the requirements or its intended purpose shall be approved by the notified body which issued the EU technical documentation assessment certificate. The provider shall inform such notified body of its intention to introduce any of the above-mentioned changes or if it becomes otherwise aware of the occurrence of such changes. The intended changes shall be assessed by the notified body which shall decide whether those changes require a new conformity assessment in accordance with Article 43(4) or whether they could be addressed by means of a supplement to the EU technical documentation assessment certificate. In the latter case, the notified body shall assess the changes, notify the provider of its decision and, where the changes are approved, issue to the provider a supplement to the EU technical documentation assessment certificate. Surveillance of the approved quality management system 5. The purpose of the surveillance carried out by the notified body referred to in Point 3 is to make sure that the provider duly fulfils the terms and conditions of the approved quality management system. For assessment purposes, the provider shall allow the notified body to access the premises where the design, development, testing of the AI systems is taking place.
