LONDON and NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2024 
The GSMA and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a new collaboration to support the adoption and skills of generative artificial intelligence
(AI) in the telecom industry through the launch of GSMA Advance's AI Training program and the GSMA Foundry Generative AI program.
The AI training program, the first in a new series of courses by GSMA Advance
, seeks to prepare telco leaders for the AI-era and bridge skills gaps in the telecom industry, by equipping members with skills and knowledge to help effectively leverage Gen AI technologies utilizing watsonx, IBM's AI and data platform with AI assistants.
The training program, designed for telecoms leaders, will span a wide range of topics, from fundamental AI principles to specialized Gen AI applications in telecoms. To ensure a wide-range of participants can benefit, GSMA Advance AI Training sessions will take place at IBM offices in five locations around the world in 2024, including Dubai, London, Mexico, New York and Seoul, and an online training program will be available in multiple languages.
A digital version of the program will be available to help address both the business strategy and technology fundamentals of Generative AI. This program will leverage IBM watsonx to deliver hands-on training designed to equip architects and developers with in-depth practical Gen AI knowledge.
The GSMA Foundry Generative AI program will provide GSMA members with access to IBM's watsonx. This platform is intended to help telecom industry players explore innovative industry-specific use cases of Generative AI, enabling members to improve cost leadership, revenue growth and enhance customer experience. As part of the ongoing collaboration GSMA Foundry and IBM will drive a series of Gen AI industry programs and challenges to investigate the use of Generative AI in various functional areas of a telecom provider.
